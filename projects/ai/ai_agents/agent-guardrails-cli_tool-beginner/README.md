# Agent Guardrails: Command-Line Tool

**Domain:** ai | **Subdomain:** ai_agents | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Agent Guardrails built as a Command-line tool. Agent guardrails are runtime checks that constrain what an agent may do: allowed tools, spending caps, forbidden topics, and required human approvals. The guardrail layer inspects every planned action and blocks or escalates violations before execution. Audit logs record every blocked attempt for review. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

**Core concept — Agent Guardrails:** Agent guardrails are runtime checks that constrain what an agent may do: allowed tools, spending caps, forbidden topics, and required human approvals. The guardrail layer inspects every planned action and blocks or escalates violations before execution. Audit logs record every blocked attempt for review.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Regulated industries wrap agents in policy checks before deployment.

## Features

- `generate_rows` (`generate_rows(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic topic rows.
- `cmd_summary` (`cmd_summary(rows, args)`): Print per-category counts and value statistics.
- `cmd_top` (`cmd_top(rows, args)`): Print the top-N rows by value.
- `cmd_filter` (`cmd_filter(rows, args)`): Print rows whose value is at least --min-value.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and dispatch to the chosen subcommand.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Deterministic synthetic rows + subcommand dispatch. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate rows; O(n log n) for top-N sort. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/ai/ai_agents/agent-guardrails-cli_tool-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Try `python3 src/main.py top --top-n 3`, `python3 src/main.py filter --min-value 900`, or add --json to any command.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

A formatted text table (or JSON with --json) for the summary, top-N, or filter subcommand.
