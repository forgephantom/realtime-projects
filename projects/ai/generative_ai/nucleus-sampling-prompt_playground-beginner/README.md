# Nucleus (Top-P) Sampler: Prompt_Playground

## Overview

Nucleus (Top-P) Sampler built as a prompt_playground. Nucleus sampling keeps the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability reaches p, adapting the candidate pool to the model's confidence: sharp distributions yield few candidates, flat ones yield many. This avoids the fixed-pool problems of top-k, where k is too big for confident steps and too small for uncertain ones. The simulator compares diversity and degeneracy across p values. A prompt template playground that substitutes variables into templates, runs A/B variants over seeded test inputs, and scores them with a rubric heuristic.

**Core concept — Nucleus (Top-P) Sampler:** Nucleus sampling keeps the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability reaches p, adapting the candidate pool to the model's confidence: sharp distributions yield few candidates, flat ones yield many. This avoids the fixed-pool problems of top-k, where k is too big for confident steps and too small for uncertain ones. The simulator compares diversity and degeneracy across p values.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Creative writing tools default to top-p sampling for varied, coherent prose.

## Features

- `render_template` (`render_template(template: str, variables: dict) -> str`): Substitute {placeholders} with variables; unknown keys stay literal.
- `build_variants` (`build_variants() -> dict`): The A/B prompt variants sharing the same variable slots.
- `make_inputs` (`make_inputs(seed: int, n: int = 6) -> list`): Seeded test inputs: topic plus a sampled question each.
- `stub_generate` (`stub_generate(prompt: str, variant: str, topic: str) -> str`): Deterministic stand-in model: prompt hash picks canned content.
- `score_response` (`score_response(response: str, variables: dict, rubric: dict) -> float`): Heuristic 0..1 score: topic term, required words, length bounds.
- `run_variant` (`run_variant(name: str, template: str, inputs: list, rubric: dict) -> dict`): Run one variant over all inputs; returns per-input scores.
- `print_table` (`print_table(results: dict) -> None`): Print the variant-by-input score table and the winner.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int) -> int`): Seeded demo: render prompts, score both variants, print the table.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Entry point: seeded prompt playground demo.

## How It Works

The project is built around Deterministic stub generation keyed by prompt hash, scored by a rubric heuristic over topic terms, required words, and length bounds.. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(V*I) for V variants over I test inputs; scoring is linear in response length.. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/ai/generative_ai/nucleus-sampling-prompt_playground-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--inputs sets the number of seeded test questions; the rubric lives in build_rubric().

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints rendered prompt samples, a variant-by-input score table with averages, and the winning variant.
