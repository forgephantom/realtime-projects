# MCP Auth Gateway Simulator: Encryption Tool

**Domain:** ai | **Subdomain:** mcp_integrations | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

MCP Auth Gateway Simulator built as a Encryption tool. Auth gateways protect MCP servers: clients present tokens on connect, the gateway validates scopes per tool, and expired tokens trigger re-authentication flows. Scope-per-tool means a file-read token cannot call a payment tool. The gateway simulates seeded auth exchanges with scope checks. Encrypts and decrypts data with a hand-written XOR stream cipher using a SHA-256 counter-mode keystream.

**Core concept — MCP Auth Gateway Simulator:** Auth gateways protect MCP servers: clients present tokens on connect, the gateway validates scopes per tool, and expired tokens trigger re-authentication flows. Scope-per-tool means a file-read token cannot call a payment tool. The gateway simulates seeded auth exchanges with scope checks.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Enterprise tool servers gate agent access with scoped tokens.

## Features

- **StreamCipher**: XOR stream cipher over a SHA-256 counter-mode keystream.
- `derive_key` (`derive_key(seed, key_text)`): Derive a 32-byte key from --key text, or from the seed by default.
- `keystream` (`keystream(key, length)`): SHA-256 counter-mode keystream of exactly `length` bytes.
- `StreamCipher.encrypt` (`StreamCipher.encrypt(self, plaintext)`): Encrypt bytes; returns ciphertext bytes.
- `StreamCipher.decrypt` (`StreamCipher.decrypt(self, ciphertext)`): Decrypt bytes; XOR is its own inverse.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args; round-trip demo, or one-shot --encrypt/--decrypt.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around XOR stream cipher with SHA-256 counter-mode keystream. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) per encrypt/decrypt of n bytes. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/ai/mcp_integrations/mcp-auth-gateway-encryption_tool-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Use `--encrypt TEXT` / `--decrypt HEX` for one-shot operations with --key.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

The default run prints plaintext, ciphertext hex, recovered text, and a MATCH/MISMATCH verdict; --encrypt/--decrypt print just the result.
