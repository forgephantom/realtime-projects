# Presentation Guide — MCP Progress Tracker: Mcp_Server_Sim

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a MCP Progress Tracker that serves tools over JSON-RPC 2.0 with proper result and error envelopes. Long tool calls report progress so clients can show spinners instead of hanging: servers send progress notifications with completed and total counts, and clients aggregate across parallel calls.

MCP Progress Tracker in two sentences: Long tool calls report progress so clients can show spinners instead of hanging: servers send progress notifications with completed and total counts, and clients aggregate across parallel calls. Cancellation tokens let users abort stuck operations. The tracker simulates seeded long calls and aggregates progress streams.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: `MCPServer` plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: JSON-RPC 2.0 dispatch over a request dict list: method lookup, tool call with validated args, result/error envelopes.; runs in O(1) per request: method dispatch plus one tool call..
- Honest scaling limit: The in-process dispatch suits demos and tests; a real server would add stdio/HTTP transport and concurrency.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a MCP Progress Tracker in Python implementing JSON-RPC 2.0 dispatch with a tool registry and structured error handling.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** How are requests routed?

**A:** Method names dispatch to handlers: initialize, tools/list, tools/call, and resources/list; anything else is a -32601 error.

**Q:** How do tools plug in?

**A:** A dict maps tool names to (function, schema) pairs; call_tool validates args, runs the function, and wraps the result.

**Q:** What resources are exposed?

**A:** resources/list exposes a server-info resource with the name and version.
