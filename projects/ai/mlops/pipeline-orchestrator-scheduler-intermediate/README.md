# ML Pipeline Orchestrator: Task Scheduler

**Domain:** ai | **Subdomain:** mlops | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

ML Pipeline Orchestrator built as a Task scheduler. An ML pipeline orchestrator chains data validation, training, evaluation, and deployment into a versioned directed graph. Each step is cached by its inputs so unchanged steps skip reruns, and conditional branches route on eval metrics. The simulator executes seeded pipeline graphs with failure injection and retry policies. Registers interval jobs on a heap scheduler, runs them for a fixed demo duration, and prints the execution log.

**Core concept — ML Pipeline Orchestrator:** An ML pipeline orchestrator chains data validation, training, evaluation, and deployment into a versioned directed graph. Each step is cached by its inputs so unchanged steps skip reruns, and conditional branches route on eval metrics. The simulator executes seeded pipeline graphs with failure injection and retry policies.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Model teams run nightly retraining pipelines as orchestrated DAGs.

## Features

- **Scheduler**: Minimal interval scheduler driven by a heap of next-run times.
- `make_demo_job` (`make_demo_job(tag)`): Build a demo job function that counts its own executions.
- `Scheduler.add_job` (`Scheduler.add_job(self, name, interval, func)`): Register `func` to run every `interval` seconds under `name`.
- `Scheduler.run` (`Scheduler.run(self, duration)`): Run scheduled jobs for `duration` seconds; return the log.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, register demo jobs, run, and print the log.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, heapq, random, time

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Heap-ordered next-run-time scheduling loop. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(log j) per execution for j jobs. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

---

## How to Run

```
cd projects/ai/mlops/pipeline-orchestrator-scheduler-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

A timestamped execution table (time, job, result) plus per-job execution counts and a total.
