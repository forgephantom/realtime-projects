# Architecture (HLD) — Confidence Calibration Analyzer: Eval_Harness

## Problem & Users

Confidence Calibration Analyzer built as a eval_harness. Calibration asks whether a model's stated confidence matches its actual accuracy: a well-calibrated model is right 80 percent of the time it says 80 percent. Reliability diagrams bin predictions by confidence and plot accuracy per bin, and expected calibration error summarizes the gap. Temperature scaling is the classic post-hoc fix for overconfidence. An evaluation harness that runs test cases against a stub model, measures accuracy and latency, and adds an LLM-as-judge rubric score per case.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in ai (model_evaluation) who needs a working, runnable reference for Confidence Calibration Analyzer — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
test cases -> run_case (stub model + latency + exact match) -> results
results + rubric -> judge_score per case -> judged scores
results + judged -> summarize -> accuracy, latency, judge averages
```

## Storage

No persistence: cases, results, and summaries are regenerated from the seed each run.

## Scaling & Limits

Sequential runs suit hundreds of cases; thousands would want parallel workers and a persistent results store.

## Trade-offs

Exact-match correctness is strict and reproducible but penalizes correct answers phrased differently; the judge score softens that.

## Failure Handling

A stub model crash is caught per case and recorded as incorrect with the error text, so one bad case never kills the run.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
