# Architecture (HLD) — Pairwise Elo Rating Arena: Web Dashboard

## Problem & Users

Pairwise Elo Rating Arena built as a Web dashboard. In a pairwise arena, judges pick the better of two model responses and Elo ratings update from wins and losses, exactly like chess rankings. The expected-score formula turns rating gaps into win probabilities, and the K-factor controls how fast ratings move. Seeded win histories let you verify the ratings converge on the true skill order. Serves a single-page HTML dashboard of topic metrics plus a JSON metrics endpoint.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in ai (model_evaluation) who needs a working, runnable reference for Pairwise Elo Rating Arena — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| DashboardHandler | main | Serves the dashboard HTML page and a JSON metrics endpoint. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
seeded RNG -> metric_rows -> render_page (HTML)
Browser/urllib GET / -> DashboardHandler -> HTML table
GET /api/metrics -> DashboardHandler -> JSON
```

## Storage

No persistence: metrics are regenerated deterministically from the seed on every request and every run.

## Scaling & Limits

Single-process threaded server rendering small pages; fine for local demos, not for high-traffic or large metric sets.

## Trade-offs

Plain HTML with no JS framework keeps it dependency-free but offers no interactivity beyond the auto-refresh meta tag.

## Failure Handling

Unknown paths return plain-text 404. The self-test asserts the title and row counts, printing FAILED if anything mismatches.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
