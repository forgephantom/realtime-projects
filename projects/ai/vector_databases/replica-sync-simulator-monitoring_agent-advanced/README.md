# Replica Sync Simulator: Monitoring Agent

**Domain:** ai | **Subdomain:** vector_databases | **Difficulty:** advanced | **Est. build time:** 8-16 hours

## Overview

Replica Sync Simulator built as a Monitoring agent. A replica sync simulator keeps read replicas consistent with the primary through async replication with bounded lag. Conflict policies handle concurrent writes during partitions. The simulation measures staleness windows under write load. Samples synthetic topic metrics for N cycles, evaluates each reading against thresholds, prints readings and alerts.

**Core concept — Replica Sync Simulator:** A replica sync simulator keeps read replicas consistent with the primary through async replication with bounded lag. Conflict policies handle concurrent writes during partitions. The simulation measures staleness windows under write load.

**Why this matters in the real world:** High-availability vector services replicate indexes across regions.

## Features

- **Monitor**: Samples metrics, evaluates thresholds, and collects alerts.
- `read_metrics` (`read_metrics(rng, cycle)`): Sample one synthetic topic metric reading.
- `check_thresholds` (`check_thresholds(reading, thresholds)`): Return a list of alert strings for readings over threshold.
- `Monitor.run` (`Monitor.run(self, cycles, interval)`): Sample `cycles` readings, print them, return alert count.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and run the monitor.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, random, time

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Periodic sampling with static threshold evaluation. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(cycles) total; O(1) per sample. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/ai/vector_databases/replica-sync-simulator-monitoring_agent-advanced
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

One line per cycle (cpu, memory, latency) with ALERT lines for threshold breaches, plus a cycle/alert summary.
