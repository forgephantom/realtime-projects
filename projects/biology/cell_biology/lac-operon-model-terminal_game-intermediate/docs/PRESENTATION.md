# Presentation Guide — Lac Operon Logic Model: Terminal Game

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a Lac Operon Logic Model with an unbeatable AI opponent that you can watch play itself or challenge directly. The lac operon switches lactose metabolism on only when lactose is present and glucose absent: the repressor blocks transcription until allolactose binds it, and CAP activates only at low glucose.

Lac Operon Logic Model in two sentences: The lac operon switches lactose metabolism on only when lactose is present and glucose absent: the repressor blocks transcription until allolactose binds it, and CAP activates only at low glucose. The model is a Boolean/logic gate combining both signals. It predicts expression across the four nutrient conditions.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Full-depth minimax tic-tac-toe with center-first deterministic move order; runs in O(b^d) minimax per move; trivial for a 3x3 board.
- Honest scaling limit: Minimax is fine for 3x3; larger boards would need depth limits or alpha-beta pruning.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Lac Operon Logic Model in Python with a full-depth minimax AI, scripted demo games, and an interactive play mode.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** Why full-depth minimax instead of a heuristic?

**A:** Tic-tac-toe is fully solved and tiny: full-depth minimax explores the whole game tree in milliseconds, so no pruning is needed.

**Q:** Is the AI's play deterministic?

**A:** Ties are broken by the fixed MOVE_ORDER (center first), so the AI's choices are identical on every run.

**Q:** How does the scoring work?

**A:** X maximizes (+1 win) and O minimizes (-1 loss); the recursion returns the best achievable score and its move.
