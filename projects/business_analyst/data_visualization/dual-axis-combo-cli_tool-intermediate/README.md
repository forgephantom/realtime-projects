# Dual Axis Chart Builder: Command-Line Tool

**Domain:** business_analyst | **Subdomain:** data_visualization | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

---

## Overview

Dual Axis Chart Builder built as a Command-line tool. A dual-axis chart plots two series with different scales, like revenue and margin percent, sharing one timeline. It invites insight but also invites distortion, so honest versions anchor both axes at meaningful baselines and label scales clearly. Used carefully, it shows relationships that separate charts hide. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

**Core concept — Dual Axis Chart Builder:** A dual-axis chart plots two series with different scales, like revenue and margin percent, sharing one timeline. It invites insight but also invites distortion, so honest versions anchor both axes at meaningful baselines and label scales clearly. Used carefully, it shows relationships that separate charts hide.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Finance presentations pair revenue with margin on dual axes to show profitable growth.

## Features

- `generate_rows` (`generate_rows(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic topic rows.
- `cmd_summary` (`cmd_summary(rows, args)`): Print per-category counts and value statistics.
- `cmd_top` (`cmd_top(rows, args)`): Print the top-N rows by value.
- `cmd_filter` (`cmd_filter(rows, args)`): Print rows whose value is at least --min-value.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and dispatch to the chosen subcommand.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Deterministic synthetic rows + subcommand dispatch. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate rows; O(n log n) for top-N sort. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/business_analyst/data_visualization/dual-axis-combo-cli_tool-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Try `python3 src/main.py top --top-n 3`, `python3 src/main.py filter --min-value 900`, or add --json to any command.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

A formatted text table (or JSON with --json) for the summary, top-N, or filter subcommand.
