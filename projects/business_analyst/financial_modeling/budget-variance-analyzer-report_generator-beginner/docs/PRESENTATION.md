# Presentation Guide — Budget Variance Analyzer: Report Generator

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a Budget Variance Analyzer that turns raw measurements into a readable Markdown report with summaries you can actually act on. Budget variance analysis compares actuals to plan and splits the gap into price, volume, and mix effects.

Budget Variance Analyzer in two sentences: Budget variance analysis compares actuals to plan and splits the gap into price, volume, and mix effects. An unfavorable variance is not automatically bad news: spending more because volume beat plan is success, while spending more at the same volume is waste. The decomposition tells which story the numbers are telling.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Seeded synthetic data generation, aggregation rollups, Markdown rendering; runs in O(n) to generate and summarize n records.
- Honest scaling limit: Holds all records in memory; millions of rows would want streaming aggregation instead.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Budget Variance Analyzer in Python that aggregates seeded measurement data into summary tables and emits a Markdown report.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** What aggregations does it compute?

**A:** summarize() rolls up requests, errors, and max p99 latency per service, plus overall totals and the error rate.

**Q:** Is the data real?

**A:** A seeded RNG produces the same dataset on every run, so the report is reproducible byte-for-byte for a given seed.

**Q:** What would change for production data?

**A:** The generator hardcodes a small service list and date window; a real version would read from logs or a database.
