# Architecture (HLD) — Dividend Discount Model: Financial_Model

## Problem & Users

Dividend Discount Model built as a financial_model. The Gordon growth version of the dividend discount model values a share as next year's dividend divided by the required return minus perpetual growth. It only fits mature, dividend-paying companies where growth is stable and below the discount rate. Its beauty is transparency: every assumption sits in the open. A financial modeler computing NPV, IRR by bisection, DCF valuation, break-even point, and a loan amortization schedule from seeded synthetic inputs.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in business_analyst (financial_modeling) who needs a working, runnable reference for Dividend Discount Model — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
seeded inputs -> cashflows, loan terms, unit economics
cashflows -> npv(rate) -> present value
cashflows -> irr (bisection) -> discount rate where NPV=0
cashflows -> dcf_value -> enterprise value with terminal value
unit economics -> breakeven -> units to cover fixed costs
loan terms -> amortization_schedule -> monthly payment table
```

## Storage

No persistence: inputs and schedules are regenerated from the seed each run.

## Scaling & Limits

Closed-form math suits any horizon; portfolio-scale use would vectorize across many projects.

## Trade-offs

Deterministic formulas are auditable but ignore taxes, inflation, and risk beyond the discount rate.

## Failure Handling

IRR raises a clear error when NPV has no sign change in the search range instead of returning a bogus rate.
