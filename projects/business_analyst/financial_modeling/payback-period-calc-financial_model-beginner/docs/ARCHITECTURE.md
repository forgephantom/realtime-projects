# Architecture (HLD) — Payback Period Calculator: Financial_Model

## Problem & Users

Payback Period Calculator built as a financial_model. The payback period counts how many years of cash inflow it takes to recover the initial outlay. It ignores the time value of money and everything after payback, which makes it crude but honest about liquidity risk. Discounted payback fixes the first flaw by discounting the inflows. A financial modeler computing NPV, IRR by bisection, DCF valuation, break-even point, and a loan amortization schedule from seeded synthetic inputs.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in business_analyst (financial_modeling) who needs a working, runnable reference for Payback Period Calculator — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
seeded inputs -> cashflows, loan terms, unit economics
cashflows -> npv(rate) -> present value
cashflows -> irr (bisection) -> discount rate where NPV=0
cashflows -> dcf_value -> enterprise value with terminal value
unit economics -> breakeven -> units to cover fixed costs
loan terms -> amortization_schedule -> monthly payment table
```

## Storage

No persistence: inputs and schedules are regenerated from the seed each run.

## Scaling & Limits

Closed-form math suits any horizon; portfolio-scale use would vectorize across many projects.

## Trade-offs

Deterministic formulas are auditable but ignore taxes, inflation, and risk beyond the discount rate.

## Failure Handling

IRR raises a clear error when NPV has no sign change in the search range instead of returning a bogus rate.
