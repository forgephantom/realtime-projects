# Presentation Guide — Sensitivity Tornado Chart: Financial_Model

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a Sensitivity Tornado Chart that prices projects with NPV, IRR, and DCF and lays out loan payments month by month. A tornado chart ranks model inputs by how much the output swings when each input moves from low to high.

Sensitivity Tornado Chart in two sentences: A tornado chart ranks model inputs by how much the output swings when each input moves from low to high. The widest bars sit on top, instantly showing which assumptions deserve diligence. It turns a hundred-line model into a prioritized list of what actually matters.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Discounted cash-flow math: NPV by discounting, IRR by bisection on NPV(r)=0, DCF with Gordon terminal value, break-even by contribution margin, amortization by the standard loan formula.; runs in O(T) per NPV/DCF over T periods; IRR bisection is O(T * iterations); amortization is O(months)..
- Honest scaling limit: Closed-form math suits any horizon; portfolio-scale use would vectorize across many projects.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Sensitivity Tornado Chart in Python implementing NPV, bisection-based IRR, DCF valuation, break-even, and amortization math.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** How does the IRR bisection work?

**A:** It brackets the root where NPV changes sign and halves the interval until NPV is within tolerance, about 200 iterations max.

**Q:** What is the terminal value?

**A:** The final-year cash flow grows forever at the terminal rate; the Gordon formula values that perpetuity and discounts it to today.

**Q:** Can it model real numbers?

**A:** Yes: npv, irr, dcf_value, breakeven, and amortization_schedule are pure functions of their inputs.
