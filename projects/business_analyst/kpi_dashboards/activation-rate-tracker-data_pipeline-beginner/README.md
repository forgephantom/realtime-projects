# Activation Rate Tracker: Data Pipeline (Etl)

## Overview

Activation Rate Tracker built as a Data pipeline (ETL). Activation rate is the share of new signups that reach the product's key first value moment, like sending a first invoice or inviting a teammate. It is the bridge between acquisition and retention: users who never activate cannot become retained. Defining activation crisply is half the work; the rest is removing friction on the path to it. Extracts synthetic topic records, transforms them (drop invalid, normalize, bucket), and loads the clean set to CSV.

**Core concept — Activation Rate Tracker:** Activation rate is the share of new signups that reach the product's key first value moment, like sending a first invoice or inviting a teammate. It is the bridge between acquisition and retention: users who never activate cannot become retained. Defining activation crisply is half the work; the rest is removing friction on the path to it.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Onboarding teams run experiments against activation rate because it predicts long-term retention.

## Features

- **Pipeline**: Three-stage ETL pipeline for topic records.
- `generate_raw` (`generate_raw(seed, n)`): Extract stage: build synthetic raw records.
- `clean_rows` (`clean_rows(rows)`): Transform stage: drop invalid rows, normalize, bucket. Returns (clean_rows, dropped_count).
- `write_csv` (`write_csv(path, rows)`): Load stage: write rows to a CSV file.
- `Pipeline.extract` (`Pipeline.extract(self, n)`): Run the extract stage and return raw rows.
- `Pipeline.transform` (`Pipeline.transform(self, rows)`): Run the transform stage and return (clean, dropped).
- `Pipeline.load` (`Pipeline.load(self, rows)`): Run the load stage; return the CSV path written.
- `Pipeline.run` (`Pipeline.run(self, n)`): Run extract -> transform -> load; print a stage report.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and run the pipeline.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Extract -> transform -> load over synthetic records. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) across all three stages. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/business_analyst/kpi_dashboards/activation-rate-tracker-data_pipeline-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
The pipeline writes demo_workspace/records_clean.csv in the current working directory; use --out-dir to change it.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A stage report table (extracted, dropped, loaded row counts), bucket distribution, five sample rows, and the CSV path.
