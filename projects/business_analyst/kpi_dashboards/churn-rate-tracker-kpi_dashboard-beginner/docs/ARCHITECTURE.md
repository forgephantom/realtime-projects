# Architecture (HLD) — Churn Rate Tracker: Kpi_Dashboard

## Problem & Users

Churn Rate Tracker built as a kpi_dashboard. Logo churn counts customers lost as a share of the starting base, while revenue churn measures dollars lost, net of expansion. Revenue churn tells the truer story because losing one enterprise account hurts more than losing ten tiny ones. Tracking both monthly exposes whether churn is a volume problem or a value problem. A KPI dashboard that computes growth rate, churn, CAC, and LTV from seeded synthetic business data and renders an ASCII dashboard with sparklines.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in business_analyst (kpi_dashboards) who needs a working, runnable reference for Churn Rate Tracker — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
seed -> generate_business_data (12 months: revenue, users, adds, churn, spend)
series -> compute_kpis -> growth rate, churn rate, CAC, LTV
series + KPIs -> sparkline + render_dashboard -> ASCII dashboard
```

## Storage

No persistence: the series is regenerated from the seed on every run.

## Scaling & Limits

In-memory series suit dashboard demos; production use would stream aggregates from a warehouse.

## Trade-offs

Synthetic data makes the demo reproducible but carries none of the messiness of real business metrics.

## Failure Handling

Zero new customers yields a reported CAC of infinity rather than a division crash, and flat series render flat sparklines.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
