# Presentation Guide — Customer Health Scorer: Kpi_Dashboard

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a Customer Health Scorer that turns raw business series into growth, churn, CAC, and LTV on one ASCII dashboard. A health score blends product usage, support tickets, payment behavior, and engagement into one 0 to 100 number per account.

Customer Health Scorer in two sentences: A health score blends product usage, support tickets, payment behavior, and engagement into one 0 to 100 number per account. The weights come from history: signals that preceded past churns earn more weight. Scores drive playbooks, so green accounts get expansion offers while red ones get save plans.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Seeded geometric-growth business series; KPIs from period ratios: growth, churn, CAC, and LTV from ARPU over churn.; runs in O(M) over M months of synthetic data; all KPI math is O(1) on aggregates..
- Honest scaling limit: In-memory series suit dashboard demos; production use would stream aggregates from a warehouse.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Customer Health Scorer in Python computing growth, churn, CAC, and LTV from synthetic business data with an ASCII dashboard.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** How is CAC computed?

**A:** Total marketing spend divided by total new customers; with zero new customers it reports infinity instead of crashing.

**Q:** How is LTV computed?

**A:** Average revenue per user divided by the churn rate, the standard payback-style lifetime estimate.

**Q:** Can it use real data?

**A:** Yes: generate_business_data only makes the demo series; compute_kpis works on any dict with the same keys.
