# Customer Health Scorer: Monitoring Agent

**Domain:** business_analyst | **Subdomain:** kpi_dashboards | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

Customer Health Scorer built as a Monitoring agent. A health score blends product usage, support tickets, payment behavior, and engagement into one 0 to 100 number per account. The weights come from history: signals that preceded past churns earn more weight. Scores drive playbooks, so green accounts get expansion offers while red ones get save plans. Samples synthetic topic metrics for N cycles, evaluates each reading against thresholds, prints readings and alerts.

**Core concept — Customer Health Scorer:** A health score blends product usage, support tickets, payment behavior, and engagement into one 0 to 100 number per account. The weights come from history: signals that preceded past churns earn more weight. Scores drive playbooks, so green accounts get expansion offers while red ones get save plans.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Customer success platforms surface health scores so CSMs prioritize the accounts most likely to churn.

## Features

- **Monitor**: Samples metrics, evaluates thresholds, and collects alerts.
- `read_metrics` (`read_metrics(rng, cycle)`): Sample one synthetic topic metric reading.
- `check_thresholds` (`check_thresholds(reading, thresholds)`): Return a list of alert strings for readings over threshold.
- `Monitor.run` (`Monitor.run(self, cycles, interval)`): Sample `cycles` readings, print them, return alert count.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and run the monitor.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Periodic sampling with static threshold evaluation. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(cycles) total; O(1) per sample. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/business_analyst/kpi_dashboards/customer-health-scorer-monitoring_agent-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

One line per cycle (cpu, memory, latency) with ALERT lines for threshold breaches, plus a cycle/alert summary.
