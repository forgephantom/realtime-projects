# Architecture (HLD) — Sales Cycle Length Analyzer: Kpi_Dashboard

## Problem & Users

Sales Cycle Length Analyzer built as a kpi_dashboard. Sales cycle length measures days from qualified opportunity to close, and it lengthens with deal size and committee buying. Segmenting cycle length by segment, source, and stage dwell time shows exactly where days pile up. Shortening the slowest stage moves revenue forward without adding headcount. A KPI dashboard that computes growth rate, churn, CAC, and LTV from seeded synthetic business data and renders an ASCII dashboard with sparklines.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in business_analyst (kpi_dashboards) who needs a working, runnable reference for Sales Cycle Length Analyzer — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
seed -> generate_business_data (12 months: revenue, users, adds, churn, spend)
series -> compute_kpis -> growth rate, churn rate, CAC, LTV
series + KPIs -> sparkline + render_dashboard -> ASCII dashboard
```

## Storage

No persistence: the series is regenerated from the seed on every run.

## Scaling & Limits

In-memory series suit dashboard demos; production use would stream aggregates from a warehouse.

## Trade-offs

Synthetic data makes the demo reproducible but carries none of the messiness of real business metrics.

## Failure Handling

Zero new customers yields a reported CAC of infinity rather than a division crash, and flat series render flat sparklines.
