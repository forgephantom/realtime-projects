# Presentation Guide — Competitor Feature Matrix: Swot_Analyzer

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a Competitor Feature Matrix that scores SWOT quadrants and turns the top factors into concrete TOWS actions. A competitor feature matrix lists capabilities as rows and competitors as columns, marking who has what.

Competitor Feature Matrix in two sentences: A competitor feature matrix lists capabilities as rows and competitors as columns, marking who has what. Gaps where nobody delivers are opportunities; rows where everyone matches are table stakes. The matrix turns scattered competitive intel into one comparable view.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Weighted scoring per SWOT quadrant (sum of weight x score), then TOWS pairing of top factors into SO/WO/ST/WT actions.; runs in O(F) over F factors; sorting for top factors is O(F log F)..
- Honest scaling limit: The math is trivial at any factor count; real use is in workshop facilitation, not computation.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Competitor Feature Matrix in Python with weighted SWOT quadrant scoring and TOWS action-item generation.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** How is a quadrant scored?

**A:** Each factor gets a weight and a 1-5 impact score; the quadrant total is the sum of weight times score.

**Q:** What does dominant mean?

**A:** The highest-scoring quadrant is the dominant one; the matrix also shows whether internal or external factors lead.

**Q:** What are TOWS actions?

**A:** Strengths with Opportunities, Weaknesses with Opportunities, Strengths with Threats, Weaknesses with Threats.
