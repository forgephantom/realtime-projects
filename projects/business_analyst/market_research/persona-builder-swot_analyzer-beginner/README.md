# Buyer Persona Builder: Swot_Analyzer

**Domain:** business_analyst | **Subdomain:** market_research | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Buyer Persona Builder built as a swot_analyzer. A buyer persona distills a segment into goals, pains, buying triggers, and decision criteria. Personas built from real interview quotes beat demographic stereotypes. The builder assembles cards from seeded notes and ties each persona to the messages that resonate. A SWOT and requirements analyzer that scores seeded factor lists per quadrant, finds the dominant quadrant, and generates TOWS action items.

**Core concept — Buyer Persona Builder:** A buyer persona distills a segment into goals, pains, buying triggers, and decision criteria. Personas built from real interview quotes beat demographic stereotypes. The builder assembles cards from seeded notes and ties each persona to the messages that resonate.

**Why this matters in the real world:** B2B marketers build personas to target campaigns and tailor messaging.

## Features

- `build_factors` (`build_factors(seed: int) -> dict`): Seeded factor lists per quadrant with weight and impact score.
- `score_quadrant` (`score_quadrant(factors: list) -> float`): Weighted total (sum of weight x score) for one quadrant.
- `categorize` (`categorize(factors: dict) -> dict`): Score all quadrants and name the dominant one.
- `tows_actions` (`tows_actions(factors: dict) -> list`): Pair top factors into SO/WO/ST/WT action items.
- `render_matrix` (`render_matrix(factors: dict, scores: dict) -> str`): Format quadrants and scores as an ASCII 2x2 matrix.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int) -> int`): Seeded demo: score quadrants, print matrix and TOWS actions.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Entry point: seeded SWOT analyzer demo.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Weighted scoring per SWOT quadrant (sum of weight x score), then TOWS pairing of top factors into SO/WO/ST/WT actions.. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(F) over F factors; sorting for top factors is O(F log F).. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/business_analyst/market_research/persona-builder-swot_analyzer-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--factors sets how many seeded factors land in each quadrant.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints an ASCII 2x2 SWOT matrix with quadrant scores and a numbered list of TOWS action items.
