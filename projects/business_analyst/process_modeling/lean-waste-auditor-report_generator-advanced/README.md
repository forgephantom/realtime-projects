# Lean Waste Auditor: Report Generator

**Domain:** business_analyst | **Subdomain:** process_modeling | **Difficulty:** advanced | **Est. build time:** 8-16 hours

## Overview

Lean Waste Auditor built as a report generator. Lean waste auditing walks a process hunting the classic wastes: waiting, overproduction, defects, motion, and excess processing. Each finding gets a type, a location, and an estimated cost. The audit report ranks wastes by savings potential so improvement starts where it pays. A report generator that builds seeded synthetic data, aggregates it, and writes a Markdown report with summary and per-service tables.

**Core concept — Lean Waste Auditor:** Lean waste auditing walks a process hunting the classic wastes: waiting, overproduction, defects, motion, and excess processing. Each finding gets a type, a location, and an estimated cost. The audit report ranks wastes by savings potential so improvement starts where it pays.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Continuous-improvement teams audit wastes quarterly to feed kaizen pipelines.

## Features

- `generate_records` (`generate_records(n: int, rng: random.Random) -> list`): Build n seeded synthetic measurement records for the demo.
- `summarize` (`summarize(records: list) -> dict`): Aggregate totals, per-service rollups, error rate, and latency peaks.
- `render_markdown` (`render_markdown(title: str, summary: dict, records: list) -> str`): Render the summary and sample rows as a Markdown document.
- `write_report` (`write_report(path: str, text: str) -> str`): Write the Markdown report, creating parent folders; return the path.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int, n_rows: int, out_path: str) -> int`): Generate data, summarize it, write the report, print a summary.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Parse flags and run the report demo.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Seeded synthetic data generation, aggregation rollups, Markdown rendering. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate and summarize n records. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/business_analyst/process_modeling/lean-waste-auditor-report_generator-advanced
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--rows sets the record count; --out sets the report path (default ./demo_output/report.md); --title sets the heading.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints aggregate stats to stdout and writes a Markdown report with summary, per-service, and sample-row tables.
