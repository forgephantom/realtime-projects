# NFR Cataloger: Eval_Harness

**Domain:** business_analyst | **Subdomain:** requirements_management | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

---

## Overview

NFR Cataloger built as a eval_harness. Non-functional requirements cover performance, security, reliability, and usability: the qualities that make software acceptable rather than just functional. They must be measurable, like response under two seconds at peak load, or they are unenforceable. A cataloger collects them by quality attribute and attaches a metric to each. An evaluation harness that runs test cases against a stub model, measures accuracy and latency, and adds an LLM-as-judge rubric score per case.

**Core concept — NFR Cataloger:** Non-functional requirements cover performance, security, reliability, and usability: the qualities that make software acceptable rather than just functional. They must be measurable, like response under two seconds at peak load, or they are unenforceable. A cataloger collects them by quality attribute and attaches a metric to each.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Architects sign off on NFR catalogs before design so qualities are engineered in.

## Features

- `build_cases` (`build_cases(seed: int, n: int = 8) -> list`): Seeded arithmetic test cases with expected answers.
- `stub_model` (`stub_model(case: dict, seed: int) -> str`): Deterministic stub model: usually right, sometimes off by one.
- `run_case` (`run_case(case: dict, model_fn, seed: int) -> dict`): Run one case: model output, latency, exact-match correctness.
- `judge_score` (`judge_score(output: str, rubric: dict) -> float`): LLM-as-judge sim: rubric checks over the output text, 0..1.
- `summarize` (`summarize(results: list, judged: list) -> dict`): Aggregate accuracy, avg/p95 latency, and average judge score.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int) -> int`): Seeded demo: run cases, judge them, print the table and summary.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Entry point: seeded eval harness demo.

## How It Works

The project is built around Each case runs a seeded stub model with latency timing, correctness is exact-match, and an LLM-as-judge rubric scores the output text.. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(N) over N test cases; each case is one stub call plus rubric checks.. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/business_analyst/requirements_management/nfr-cataloger-eval_harness-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--cases sets the number of seeded test cases; the judge rubric lives in build_rubric().

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints a per-case table (input, expected, output, correct, latency, judge score) and a summary line with accuracy and latency stats.
