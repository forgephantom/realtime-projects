# Dependency Status Board: Monitoring Agent

**Domain:** business_analyst | **Subdomain:** stakeholder_reporting | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

Dependency Status Board built as a Monitoring agent. A dependency board maps which teams or projects depend on which deliverables, with dates and owners. Broken dependencies are the most common cause of surprise delays. The board tracks each dependency's health and escalates the ones drifting toward their need-by dates. Samples synthetic topic metrics for N cycles, evaluates each reading against thresholds, prints readings and alerts.

**Core concept — Dependency Status Board:** A dependency board maps which teams or projects depend on which deliverables, with dates and owners. Broken dependencies are the most common cause of surprise delays. The board tracks each dependency's health and escalates the ones drifting toward their need-by dates.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Program managers track dependencies across teams to prevent integration surprises.

## Features

- **Monitor**: Samples metrics, evaluates thresholds, and collects alerts.
- `read_metrics` (`read_metrics(rng, cycle)`): Sample one synthetic topic metric reading.
- `check_thresholds` (`check_thresholds(reading, thresholds)`): Return a list of alert strings for readings over threshold.
- `Monitor.run` (`Monitor.run(self, cycles, interval)`): Sample `cycles` readings, print them, return alert count.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and run the monitor.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, random, time

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Periodic sampling with static threshold evaluation. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(cycles) total; O(1) per sample. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

---

## How to Run

```
cd projects/business_analyst/stakeholder_reporting/dependency-status-board-monitoring_agent-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

One line per cycle (cpu, memory, latency) with ALERT lines for threshold breaches, plus a cycle/alert summary.
