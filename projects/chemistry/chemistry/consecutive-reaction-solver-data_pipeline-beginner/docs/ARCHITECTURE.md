# Architecture (HLD) — Consecutive Reaction Solver: Data Pipeline (Etl)

## Problem & Users

Consecutive Reaction Solver built as a Data pipeline (ETL). In A to B to C sequences, the intermediate B rises then falls as it is made and consumed. Solving the coupled equations shows when B peaks, which matters for isolating it before it reacts away. Extracts synthetic topic records, transforms them (drop invalid, normalize, bucket), and loads the clean set to CSV.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in chemistry (chemistry) who needs a working, runnable reference for Consecutive Reaction Solver — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline | main | Three-stage ETL pipeline for topic records. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
generate_raw (extract) -> clean_rows (transform)
clean_rows -> write_csv (load) -> demo_workspace/records_clean.csv
Pipeline.run prints per-stage row counts
```

## Storage

The only persistence is the output CSV written to ./demo_workspace; the raw and intermediate rows exist only in memory during the run.

## Scaling & Limits

All rows are held in memory between stages, so very large inputs would need chunked or streaming processing instead.

## Trade-offs

In-memory batch processing keeps the code simple and fast for demo sizes, at the cost of not streaming arbitrarily large datasets.

## Failure Handling

Corrupt rows (null or negative values) are counted and dropped in the transform stage rather than crashing the pipeline; an empty input writes a header-only CSV.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
