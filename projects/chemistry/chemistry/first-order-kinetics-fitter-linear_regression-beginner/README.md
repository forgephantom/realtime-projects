# First Order Kinetics Fitter: Linear Regression

**Domain:** chemistry | **Subdomain:** chemistry | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

First Order Kinetics Fitter built as a Linear regression. In a first-order reaction the rate is proportional to the remaining reactant, so concentration decays exponentially and the log of concentration falls on a straight line. The slope of that line is the rate constant. Fits y = slope*x + intercept by closed-form least squares on seeded synthetic data and reports coefficients, R^2, and predictions.

**Core concept — First Order Kinetics Fitter:** In a first-order reaction the rate is proportional to the remaining reactant, so concentration decays exponentially and the log of concentration falls on a straight line. The slope of that line is the rate constant.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Pharmaceutical teams measure drug degradation rates with first-order kinetic fits.

## Features

- `generate_data` (`generate_data(seed, n, slope, intercept, noise)`): Generate noisy (x, y) pairs around the true line.
- `fit_least_squares` (`fit_least_squares(xs, ys)`): Closed-form least-squares fit; returns (slope, intercept).
- `r_squared` (`r_squared(xs, ys, slope, intercept)`): Coefficient of determination for the fitted line.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, fit, and print coefficients and predictions.

## How It Works

The project is built around Ordinary least squares, closed-form normal equations. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to fit n points. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/chemistry/chemistry/first-order-kinetics-fitter-linear_regression-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

True vs fitted line coefficients, R^2, and an 8-row prediction table (x, y_true, y_pred, residual).
