# Presentation Guide — Cross Region Replication Monitor: Web Dashboard

## 60-Second Pitch

A zero-dependency Cross Region Replication Monitor dashboard that renders live metrics as HTML and JSON, verified end to end by its own self-test. Cross-region replication gives disaster recovery, but lag determines data loss on failover.

Cross Region Replication Monitor in two sentences: Cross-region replication gives disaster recovery, but lag determines data loss on failover. The monitor tracks replication lag, backlog, and throughput per region pair, alerting before lag exceeds RPO. It watches the safety net.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: `DashboardHandler` plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Server-side HTML rendering of a metrics table; runs in O(n) to render n metric rows.
- Honest scaling limit: Single-process threaded server rendering small pages; fine for local demos, not for high-traffic or large metric sets.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Cross Region Replication Monitor web dashboard in Python (stdlib http.server) rendering a server-side HTML metrics table with a JSON API; default run self-tests both endpoints on 127.0.0.1 and prints verification results.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** Does the page need JavaScript?

**A:** No; the table is rendered server-side as plain HTML, with a meta refresh tag for periodic updates.

**Q:** Where do the metrics come from?

**A:** A seeded RNG generates deterministic synthetic rows, so the dashboard is reproducible without any external data source.

**Q:** Can it serve persistently?

**A:** Yes, pass --serve to keep the ThreadingHTTPServer running on 127.0.0.1 until interrupted.
