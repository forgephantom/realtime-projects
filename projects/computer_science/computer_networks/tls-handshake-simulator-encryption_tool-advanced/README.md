# TLS Handshake Simulator: Encryption Tool

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** computer_networks | **Difficulty:** advanced | **Est. build time:** 8-16 hours

## Overview

TLS Handshake Simulator built as a Encryption tool. The TLS handshake negotiates securely: ClientHello offers versions and cipher suites, the server picks and presents its certificate, key exchange establishes session keys, and Finished messages authenticate the transcript. The simulator walks each message with seeded parameters, showing where each secret is born. Encrypts and decrypts data with a hand-written XOR stream cipher using a SHA-256 counter-mode keystream.

**Core concept — TLS Handshake Simulator:** The TLS handshake negotiates securely: ClientHello offers versions and cipher suites, the server picks and presents its certificate, key exchange establishes session keys, and Finished messages authenticate the transcript. The simulator walks each message with seeded parameters, showing where each secret is born.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Every HTTPS connection performs the TLS handshake.

## Features

- **StreamCipher**: XOR stream cipher over a SHA-256 counter-mode keystream.
- `derive_key` (`derive_key(seed, key_text)`): Derive a 32-byte key from --key text, or from the seed by default.
- `keystream` (`keystream(key, length)`): SHA-256 counter-mode keystream of exactly `length` bytes.
- `StreamCipher.encrypt` (`StreamCipher.encrypt(self, plaintext)`): Encrypt bytes; returns ciphertext bytes.
- `StreamCipher.decrypt` (`StreamCipher.decrypt(self, ciphertext)`): Decrypt bytes; XOR is its own inverse.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args; round-trip demo, or one-shot --encrypt/--decrypt.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around XOR stream cipher with SHA-256 counter-mode keystream. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) per encrypt/decrypt of n bytes. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/computer_networks/tls-handshake-simulator-encryption_tool-advanced
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Use `--encrypt TEXT` / `--decrypt HEX` for one-shot operations with --key.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

The default run prints plaintext, ciphertext hex, recovered text, and a MATCH/MISMATCH verdict; --encrypt/--decrypt print just the result.
