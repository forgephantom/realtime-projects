# API Abuse Rate Detector: Statistical Analyzer

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** cybersecurity | **Difficulty:** advanced | **Est. build time:** 8-16 hours

---

## Overview

API Abuse Rate Detector built as a Statistical analyzer. Legitimate API clients behave predictably while scrapers and attackers hammer endpoints at inhuman rates or probe for IDOR patterns. The detector profiles per-key request rates, endpoint entropy, and error ratios, flagging keys whose behavior diverges from their historical norm. It separates a viral launch from an attack by looking at error and spread patterns. Draws a seeded synthetic sample and reports count, mean, median, stdev, quartiles, and an ASCII histogram.

**Core concept — API Abuse Rate Detector:** Legitimate API clients behave predictably while scrapers and attackers hammer endpoints at inhuman rates or probe for IDOR patterns. The detector profiles per-key request rates, endpoint entropy, and error ratios, flagging keys whose behavior diverges from their historical norm. It separates a viral launch from an attack by looking at error and spread patterns.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used by API platform teams protecting public endpoints.

## Features

- `generate_sample` (`generate_sample(seed, n)`): Draw synthetic topic measurements (mixture model).
- `percentile` (`percentile(sorted_vals, q)`): Linear-interpolation percentile of a pre-sorted list.
- `summarize` (`summarize(values, bins)`): Compute a full descriptive-statistics summary.
- `print_report` (`print_report(summary)`): Print the summary table and ASCII histogram.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and print the report.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Descriptive statistics with linear-interpolation percentiles. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n log n) for the sort; O(n) for the histogram pass. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/cybersecurity/api-abuse-rate-detector-statistical_analyzer-advanced
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A statistics table (count, mean, median, stdev, min, p25, p75, max) followed by an ASCII histogram.
