# Architecture (HLD) — Auth Failure Heatmap: Log Analyzer

## Problem & Users

Auth Failure Heatmap built as a Log analyzer. Failed logins cluster by hour, by source country, and by targeted account, and a heatmap makes those clusters obvious. The tool bins authentication failures across time and dimensions and renders intensity maps that reveal brute-force campaigns and password-spray waves. Analysts pivot from a hot cell straight into the underlying events. Generates a synthetic service log in memory, parses each line with a regex, and reports level/service counts, top errors, and error rate.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (cybersecurity) who needs a working, runnable reference for Auth Failure Heatmap — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
--seed -> generate_log (in-memory lines)
lines -> parse_line (regex) -> entry dicts
entries -> analyze (Counters) -> print_report
```

## Storage

In-memory only: the synthetic log and aggregates exist for the run; nothing is read from or written to disk.

## Scaling & Limits

Lines are held in memory, so multi-gigabyte logs would need a streaming line-by-line variant of the same pipeline.

## Trade-offs

A single regex keeps parsing fast and readable but only handles the one log format the generator emits.

## Failure Handling

Lines that do not match the regex are skipped and excluded from totals, so a corrupt line can never crash the analysis.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
