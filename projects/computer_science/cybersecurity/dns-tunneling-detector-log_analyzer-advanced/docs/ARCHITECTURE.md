# Architecture (HLD) — DNS Tunneling Detector: Log Analyzer

## Problem & Users

DNS Tunneling Detector built as a Log analyzer. DNS tunneling smuggles data out of a network by encoding it in subdomain labels of DNS queries, abusing a protocol that firewalls almost always allow. The detector scores queries on label entropy, query length, request frequency, and the rarity of the queried domain, because tunneled traffic looks random and chatty compared with human browsing. High-scoring domains get quarantined for analyst review. Generates a synthetic service log in memory, parses each line with a regex, and reports level/service counts, top errors, and error rate.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (cybersecurity) who needs a working, runnable reference for DNS Tunneling Detector — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
--seed -> generate_log (in-memory lines)
lines -> parse_line (regex) -> entry dicts
entries -> analyze (Counters) -> print_report
```

## Storage

In-memory only: the synthetic log and aggregates exist for the run; nothing is read from or written to disk.

## Scaling & Limits

Lines are held in memory, so multi-gigabyte logs would need a streaming line-by-line variant of the same pipeline.

## Trade-offs

A single regex keeps parsing fast and readable but only handles the one log format the generator emits.

## Failure Handling

Lines that do not match the regex are skipped and excluded from totals, so a corrupt line can never crash the analysis.
