# Architecture (HLD) — Firewall Rule Simulator: Command-Line Tool

## Problem & Users

Firewall Rule Simulator built as a Command-line tool. Firewall policies are ordered rule lists where the first match wins, and a misplaced permissive rule can silently shadow stricter ones below it. The simulator evaluates packets against a rule set, shows exactly which rule matched and why, and audits the policy for shadowed rules, overly broad allows, and default-deny gaps. It lets engineers test policy changes safely before pushing them to production. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (cybersecurity) who needs a working, runnable reference for Firewall Rule Simulator — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
--seed -> generate_rows (synthetic table)
subcommand: summary | top | filter -> formatted table or JSON
```

## Storage

No persistence: rows are regenerated from the seed on every invocation and nothing is written to disk.

## Scaling & Limits

Rows live in a Python list, so memory grows linearly with --rows; fine for tens of thousands of rows on a laptop.

## Trade-offs

Synthetic seeded data keeps the tool self-contained and reproducible, at the cost of not reading real input files.

## Failure Handling

An empty filter result prints a zero-count table rather than erroring; --top-n larger than the row count simply returns all rows.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
