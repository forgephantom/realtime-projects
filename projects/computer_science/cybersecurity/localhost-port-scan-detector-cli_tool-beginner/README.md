# Localhost Port Scan Detector: Command-Line Tool

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** cybersecurity | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Localhost Port Scan Detector built as a Command-line tool. Port scans probe many ports to map which services are listening, and the scan itself is visible as a burst of short connections across a port range. This localhost-only detector binds no remote targets: it watches connection attempts against the local machine, counts distinct ports touched per source within a window, and classifies the pattern as a horizontal scan, a vertical scan, or normal churn. It is strictly defensive and never scans anyone else. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

**Core concept — Localhost Port Scan Detector:** Port scans probe many ports to map which services are listening, and the scan itself is visible as a burst of short connections across a port range. This localhost-only detector binds no remote targets: it watches connection attempts against the local machine, counts distinct ports touched per source within a window, and classifies the pattern as a horizontal scan, a vertical scan, or normal churn. It is strictly defensive and never scans anyone else.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used by host-based intrusion detection on workstations and servers to spot reconnaissance.

## Features

- `generate_rows` (`generate_rows(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic topic rows.
- `cmd_summary` (`cmd_summary(rows, args)`): Print per-category counts and value statistics.
- `cmd_top` (`cmd_top(rows, args)`): Print the top-N rows by value.
- `cmd_filter` (`cmd_filter(rows, args)`): Print rows whose value is at least --min-value.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and dispatch to the chosen subcommand.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Deterministic synthetic rows + subcommand dispatch. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate rows; O(n log n) for top-N sort. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/cybersecurity/localhost-port-scan-detector-cli_tool-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Try `python3 src/main.py top --top-n 3`, `python3 src/main.py filter --min-value 900`, or add --json to any command.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

A formatted text table (or JSON with --json) for the summary, top-N, or filter subcommand.
