# Presentation Guide — Network Traffic Baseliner: Statistical Analyzer

## 60-Second Pitch

A Network Traffic Baseliner statistics tool that turns a seeded synthetic sample into a full descriptive report with quartiles and an ASCII histogram. You cannot spot abnormal traffic without knowing what normal looks like, so a baseliner records bytes, flows, ports, and peer counts per host over time.

Network Traffic Baseliner in two sentences: You cannot spot abnormal traffic without knowing what normal looks like, so a baseliner records bytes, flows, ports, and peer counts per host over time. It stores hourly profiles and compares live traffic against them with simple statistical distance, producing a ranked list of the most deviant hosts. Analysts start investigations from the top of that list.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Descriptive statistics with linear-interpolation percentiles; runs in O(n log n) for the sort; O(n) for the histogram pass.
- Honest scaling limit: The sample is sorted in memory, so multi-million-point samples would need a streaming quantile sketch instead.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Network Traffic Baseliner statistical analyzer in pure Python computing mean, median, stdev, quartiles, and histograms from seeded synthetic data; prints a formatted report with an ASCII distribution plot.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** What distribution does the sample follow?

**A:** A two-component Gaussian mixture, which gives the histogram a visible bimodal shape instead of a flat bell curve.

**Q:** Are the sample size and bins configurable?

**A:** Yes; pass --samples and --bins to control the draw size and histogram resolution.

**Q:** Does it save the report anywhere?

**A:** No; it prints to stdout only, so results can be redirected or piped freely.
