# Architecture (HLD) — Password Hash Algorithm Auditor: Command-Line Tool

## Problem & Users

Password Hash Algorithm Auditor built as a Command-line tool. Storing passwords with fast hashes like MD5 or SHA-256 lets attackers test billions of guesses per second after a breach, while memory-hard functions like Argon2id and bcrypt slow them dramatically. This auditor inspects a password database dump format, identifies the algorithm and parameters behind each hash prefix, and flags anything below the current policy bar. It never cracks anything; it grades the storage hygiene. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (cybersecurity) who needs a working, runnable reference for Password Hash Algorithm Auditor — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
--seed -> generate_rows (synthetic table)
subcommand: summary | top | filter -> formatted table or JSON
```

## Storage

No persistence: rows are regenerated from the seed on every invocation and nothing is written to disk.

## Scaling & Limits

Rows live in a Python list, so memory grows linearly with --rows; fine for tens of thousands of rows on a laptop.

## Trade-offs

Synthetic seeded data keeps the tool self-contained and reproducible, at the cost of not reading real input files.

## Failure Handling

An empty filter result prints a zero-count table rather than erroring; --top-n larger than the row count simply returns all rows.
