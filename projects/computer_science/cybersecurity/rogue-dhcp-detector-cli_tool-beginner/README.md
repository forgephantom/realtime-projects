# Rogue DHCP Detector: Command-Line Tool

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** cybersecurity | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Rogue DHCP Detector built as a Command-line tool. A rogue DHCP server hands out malicious gateway and DNS settings, silently rerouting a LAN's traffic through the attacker. The detector listens for DHCP offers and compares responding server identities against the authorized list, flagging any unknown server instantly. It also watches for offers with suspiciously short leases or odd options. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

**Core concept — Rogue DHCP Detector:** A rogue DHCP server hands out malicious gateway and DNS settings, silently rerouting a LAN's traffic through the attacker. The detector listens for DHCP offers and compares responding server identities against the authorized list, flagging any unknown server instantly. It also watches for offers with suspiciously short leases or odd options.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used by network teams on large or shared LANs.

## Features

- `generate_rows` (`generate_rows(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic topic rows.
- `cmd_summary` (`cmd_summary(rows, args)`): Print per-category counts and value statistics.
- `cmd_top` (`cmd_top(rows, args)`): Print the top-N rows by value.
- `cmd_filter` (`cmd_filter(rows, args)`): Print rows whose value is at least --min-value.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and dispatch to the chosen subcommand.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Deterministic synthetic rows + subcommand dispatch. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate rows; O(n log n) for top-N sort. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/cybersecurity/rogue-dhcp-detector-cli_tool-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Try `python3 src/main.py top --top-n 3`, `python3 src/main.py filter --min-value 900`, or add --json to any command.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

A formatted text table (or JSON with --json) for the summary, top-N, or filter subcommand.
