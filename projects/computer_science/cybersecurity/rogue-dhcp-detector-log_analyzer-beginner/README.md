# Rogue DHCP Detector: Log Analyzer

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** cybersecurity | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

---

## Overview

Rogue DHCP Detector built as a Log analyzer. A rogue DHCP server hands out malicious gateway and DNS settings, silently rerouting a LAN's traffic through the attacker. The detector listens for DHCP offers and compares responding server identities against the authorized list, flagging any unknown server instantly. It also watches for offers with suspiciously short leases or odd options. Generates a synthetic service log in memory, parses each line with a regex, and reports level/service counts, top errors, and error rate.

**Core concept — Rogue DHCP Detector:** A rogue DHCP server hands out malicious gateway and DNS settings, silently rerouting a LAN's traffic through the attacker. The detector listens for DHCP offers and compares responding server identities against the authorized list, flagging any unknown server instantly. It also watches for offers with suspiciously short leases or odd options.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used by network teams on large or shared LANs.

## Features

- `generate_log` (`generate_log(seed, lines)`): Generate synthetic topic log lines in memory.
- `parse_line` (`parse_line(line)`): Parse one log line; return a dict or None if unparseable.
- `analyze` (`analyze(entries)`): Aggregate level counts, service counts, and top error messages.
- `print_report` (`print_report(report, total)`): Print the analysis report.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, generate, parse, and report.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, random, re, collections, datetime

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Regex parsing with Counter aggregation. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate, parse, and aggregate n lines. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/cybersecurity/rogue-dhcp-detector-log_analyzer-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Level counts with percentages, service counts, the error rate, and the top five error messages with counts.
