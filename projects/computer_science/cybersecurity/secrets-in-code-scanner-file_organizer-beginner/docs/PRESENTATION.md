# Presentation Guide — Secrets in Code Scanner: File Organizer

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a Secrets in Code Scanner that tidies a messy folder into categorized subfolders, showing you the plan before it moves anything. API keys and passwords committed to repositories get scraped by attackers within minutes of a public push.

Secrets in Code Scanner in two sentences: API keys and passwords committed to repositories get scraped by attackers within minutes of a public push. The scanner walks a codebase looking for high-entropy strings, known key prefixes, and assignment patterns like password equals, then filters out test fixtures and placeholders. Findings include the file, line, and secret type so rotation can start immediately.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: `FileOrganizer` plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Extension-to-folder mapping with a plan-then-execute move pass; runs in O(f) over f files.
- Honest scaling limit: Single-machine, single-threaded moves; fine for thousands of files, not a distributed file pipeline.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Secrets in Code Scanner in Python that sorts files into extension-mapped folders with a plan-then-execute pass and dry-run mode.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** How does it decide which folder a file goes to?

**A:** The extension map comes from {'entropy_threshold': 'Shannon entropy that marks a string secret-like', 'key_prefixes': 'known prefixes like sk-live or AKIA to match', 'ignore_tests': 'whether test directories are skipped', 'min_length': 'shortest string considered'}; any extension not listed is routed to a 'misc' folder.

**Q:** What is the point of plan() versus execute()?

**A:** plan() computes every move first, so --dry-run can show the full plan and execute() just carries it out.

**Q:** Is the demo safe to rerun?

**A:** Yes: the demo wipes and recreates ./demo_workspace at startup, so reruns are clean and deterministic.
