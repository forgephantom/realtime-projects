# Presentation Guide — SQL Injection Payload Screener: Report Generator

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a SQL Injection Payload Screener that turns raw measurements into a readable Markdown report with summaries you can actually act on. SQL injection happens when untrusted input is concatenated into database queries, letting an attacker alter the query logic with quotes, comments, and stacked statements.

SQL Injection Payload Screener in two sentences: SQL injection happens when untrusted input is concatenated into database queries, letting an attacker alter the query logic with quotes, comments, and stacked statements. The screener is a defensive input validator that scores incoming parameters against patterns for tautologies, union selects, stacked queries, and time-based blind probes without ever executing them. It reports which rule fired and a risk score so developers can find weak validation before attackers do.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Seeded synthetic data generation, aggregation rollups, Markdown rendering; runs in O(n) to generate and summarize n records.
- Honest scaling limit: Holds all records in memory; millions of rows would want streaming aggregation instead.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a SQL Injection Payload Screener in Python that aggregates seeded measurement data into summary tables and emits a Markdown report.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** What aggregations does it compute?

**A:** summarize() rolls up requests, errors, and max p99 latency per service, plus overall totals and the error rate.

**Q:** Is the data real?

**A:** A seeded RNG produces the same dataset on every run, so the report is reproducible byte-for-byte for a given seed.

**Q:** What would change for production data?

**A:** The generator hardcodes a small service list and date window; a real version would read from logs or a database.
