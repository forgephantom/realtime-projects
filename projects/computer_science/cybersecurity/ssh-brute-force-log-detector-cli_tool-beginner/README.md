# SSH Brute-Force Log Detector: Command-Line Tool

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** cybersecurity | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

---

## Overview

SSH Brute-Force Log Detector built as a Command-line tool. Attackers guess SSH credentials by trying many username and password pairs against port 22, which leaves a trail of failed password lines in the auth log. The detector parses those log lines, groups failures by source IP and username, and raises an alert when the failure rate exceeds a policy, distinguishing slow stealthy guessing from noisy bursts. It can emit ready-to-use blocklist entries for fail2ban style tooling. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

**Core concept — SSH Brute-Force Log Detector:** Attackers guess SSH credentials by trying many username and password pairs against port 22, which leaves a trail of failed password lines in the auth log. The detector parses those log lines, groups failures by source IP and username, and raises an alert when the failure rate exceeds a policy, distinguishing slow stealthy guessing from noisy bursts. It can emit ready-to-use blocklist entries for fail2ban style tooling.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used by sysadmins and SOC analysts to catch credential-guessing campaigns against Linux servers.

## Features

- `generate_rows` (`generate_rows(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic topic rows.
- `cmd_summary` (`cmd_summary(rows, args)`): Print per-category counts and value statistics.
- `cmd_top` (`cmd_top(rows, args)`): Print the top-N rows by value.
- `cmd_filter` (`cmd_filter(rows, args)`): Print rows whose value is at least --min-value.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and dispatch to the chosen subcommand.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Deterministic synthetic rows + subcommand dispatch. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate rows; O(n log n) for top-N sort. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/cybersecurity/ssh-brute-force-log-detector-cli_tool-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Try `python3 src/main.py top --top-n 3`, `python3 src/main.py filter --min-value 900`, or add --json to any command.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

A formatted text table (or JSON with --json) for the summary, top-N, or filter subcommand.
