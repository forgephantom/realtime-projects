# Presentation Guide — SSH Brute-Force Log Detector: Command-Line Tool

## 60-Second Pitch

A SSH Brute-Force Log Detector command-line tool with summary, top-N, and filter subcommands that works on reproducible seeded data and emits tables or JSON. Attackers guess SSH credentials by trying many username and password pairs against port 22, which leaves a trail of failed password lines in the auth log.

SSH Brute-Force Log Detector in two sentences: Attackers guess SSH credentials by trying many username and password pairs against port 22, which leaves a trail of failed password lines in the auth log. The detector parses those log lines, groups failures by source IP and username, and raises an alert when the failure rate exceeds a policy, distinguishing slow stealthy guessing from noisy bursts. It can emit ready-to-use blocklist entries for fail2ban style tooling.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Deterministic synthetic rows + subcommand dispatch; runs in O(n) to generate rows; O(n log n) for top-N sort.
- Honest scaling limit: Rows live in a Python list, so memory grows linearly with --rows; fine for tens of thousands of rows on a laptop.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a SSH Brute-Force Log Detector CLI tool in Python (argparse subcommands) over seeded synthetic data with table and JSON output; runs summary, top-N, and filter reports deterministically.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** What runs when no subcommand is given?

**A:** It prints the summary table, so `python3 src/main.py` alone is a complete demo.

**Q:** Can it output JSON?

**A:** Yes; pass --json to get machine-readable output from any subcommand.

**Q:** How does it handle large row counts?

**A:** Increase --rows; filtering and sorting stay linear-ish and the tool prints the first 20 filtered rows with a remainder count.
