# Simpson's Paradox Demo: Simulation (Logistic Growth)

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** data_science | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Simpson's Paradox Demo built as a Simulation (logistic growth). Simpson's paradox flips conclusions when groups combine: a treatment can look worse overall yet better within every subgroup, when group sizes and base rates differ. The demo constructs the paradox numerically and shows the correct stratified analysis. It is the canonical warning against naive aggregation. Euler-integrates logistic growth dP/dt = r*P*(1-P/K) and prints the trajectory table with summary statistics.

**Core concept — Simpson's Paradox Demo:** Simpson's paradox flips conclusions when groups combine: a treatment can look worse overall yet better within every subgroup, when group sizes and base rates differ. The demo constructs the paradox numerically and shows the correct stratified analysis. It is the canonical warning against naive aggregation.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Medical trials, hiring audits, and A/B test subgroup analyses must check for Simpson reversals.

## Features

- `simulate` (`simulate(params, steps, dt)`): Euler-integrate logistic growth; return [(t, value)] rows.
- `print_trajectory` (`print_trajectory(rows, every)`): Print every Nth trajectory row plus the final state.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, simulate, and print the trajectory and summary.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Explicit Euler integration of logistic growth. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(steps). See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/data_science/simpsons-paradox-demo-simulation-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A sampled trajectory table (t, value) plus start, end, peak, and carrying-capacity summary lines.
