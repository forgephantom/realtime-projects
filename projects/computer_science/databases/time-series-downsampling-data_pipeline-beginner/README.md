# Time-Series Downsampling: Data Pipeline (Etl)

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** databases | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Time-Series Downsampling built as a Data pipeline (ETL). Raw metrics are too fine to keep forever: the downsampler aggregates (avg/max/min) into coarser rollups per retention tier, preserving extremes via min/max alongside means. It implements tiered retention (raw 7d, hourly 1y). Queries pick the finest tier covering the range. Extracts synthetic topic records, transforms them (drop invalid, normalize, bucket), and loads the clean set to CSV.

**Core concept — Time-Series Downsampling:** Raw metrics are too fine to keep forever: the downsampler aggregates (avg/max/min) into coarser rollups per retention tier, preserving extremes via min/max alongside means. It implements tiered retention (raw 7d, hourly 1y). Queries pick the finest tier covering the range.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Prometheus, InfluxDB, and Graphite downsample with tiered retention.

## Features

- **Pipeline**: Three-stage ETL pipeline for topic records.
- `generate_raw` (`generate_raw(seed, n)`): Extract stage: build synthetic raw records.
- `clean_rows` (`clean_rows(rows)`): Transform stage: drop invalid rows, normalize, bucket. Returns (clean_rows, dropped_count).
- `write_csv` (`write_csv(path, rows)`): Load stage: write rows to a CSV file.
- `Pipeline.extract` (`Pipeline.extract(self, n)`): Run the extract stage and return raw rows.
- `Pipeline.transform` (`Pipeline.transform(self, rows)`): Run the transform stage and return (clean, dropped).
- `Pipeline.load` (`Pipeline.load(self, rows)`): Run the load stage; return the CSV path written.
- `Pipeline.run` (`Pipeline.run(self, n)`): Run extract -> transform -> load; print a stage report.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and run the pipeline.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Extract -> transform -> load over synthetic records. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) across all three stages. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/databases/time-series-downsampling-data_pipeline-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
The pipeline writes demo_workspace/records_clean.csv in the current working directory; use --out-dir to change it.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A stage report table (extracted, dropped, loaded row counts), bucket distribution, five sample rows, and the CSV path.
