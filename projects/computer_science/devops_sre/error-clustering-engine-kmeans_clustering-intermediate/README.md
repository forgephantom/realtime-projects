# Error Clustering Engine: K-Means Clustering

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** devops_sre | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

---

## Overview

Error Clustering Engine built as a K-means clustering. Thousands of error instances usually reduce to a handful of root causes, and clustering finds them. The engine groups errors by normalized message, stack signature, and context, ranking clusters by frequency and blast radius. Triage starts with clusters, not instances. Runs Lloyd's k-means on seeded 2-D synthetic points and prints final centroids, cluster sizes, and inertia.

**Core concept — Error Clustering Engine:** Thousands of error instances usually reduce to a handful of root causes, and clustering finds them. The engine groups errors by normalized message, stack signature, and context, ranking clusters by frequency and blast radius. Triage starts with clusters, not instances.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used by on-call teams triaging error floods.

## Features

- `generate_points` (`generate_points(seed, n, k)`): Generate 2-D points around k random topic centers.
- `assign` (`assign(points, centroids)`): Assign each point to its nearest centroid; return label list.
- `recompute` (`recompute(points, labels, k, centroids)`): Recompute centroids as cluster means; keep old center if empty.
- `inertia` (`inertia(points, labels, centroids)`): Sum of squared distances of points to their assigned centroid.
- `kmeans` (`kmeans(points, k, iterations, seed)`): Run Lloyd's algorithm; return (centroids, labels).
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, cluster, and print centroids and inertia.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Lloyd's k-means: assign, recompute, repeat until convergence. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n*k*i) for n points, k clusters, i iterations. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/devops_sre/error-clustering-engine-kmeans_clustering-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A cluster table (id, centroid x/y, size) and the final inertia value.
