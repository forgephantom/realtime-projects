# Presentation Guide — Membership Failure Detector: Simulation (Logistic Growth)

## 60-Second Pitch

A Membership Failure Detector simulation in pure Python that integrates logistic growth with Euler steps and prints the full trajectory toward carrying capacity. Clusters must notice dead members quickly without false accusations from slow networks.

Membership Failure Detector in two sentences: Clusters must notice dead members quickly without false accusations from slow networks. The simulator implements SWIM-style suspicion with direct and indirect probing, tuning the tradeoff between detection speed and false positives. It shows how gossip-based failure detection stays scalable.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Explicit Euler integration of logistic growth; runs in O(steps).
- Honest scaling limit: The trajectory is a plain list, so millions of steps would use noticeable memory; streaming or downsampling would fix that.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Membership Failure Detector simulator in Python (stdlib) implementing Euler integration of logistic growth with seeded parameters; demo runs end-to-end and prints the trajectory table with summary statistics.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** What dynamics does the model show?

**A:** Logistic growth: fast early rise that levels off at the carrying capacity K, a common shape for adoption and saturation processes.

**Q:** How is accuracy controlled?

**A:** --steps and --dt; smaller dt is more accurate, larger dt runs faster but can overshoot.

**Q:** Why Euler instead of RK4?

**A:** Euler is first-order and simple to read; the template favors clarity over the accuracy of higher-order integrators.
