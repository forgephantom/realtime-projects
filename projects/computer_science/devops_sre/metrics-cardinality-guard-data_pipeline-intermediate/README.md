# Metrics Cardinality Guard: Data Pipeline (Etl)

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** devops_sre | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

Metrics Cardinality Guard built as a Data pipeline (ETL). High-cardinality labels like user IDs explode metrics storage and crash the monitoring itself. The guard analyzes label cardinality per metric, flags runaway series counts, and suggests aggregation or label drops. It protects the monitoring system from the monitored system. Extracts synthetic topic records, transforms them (drop invalid, normalize, bucket), and loads the clean set to CSV.

**Core concept — Metrics Cardinality Guard:** High-cardinality labels like user IDs explode metrics storage and crash the monitoring itself. The guard analyzes label cardinality per metric, flags runaway series counts, and suggests aggregation or label drops. It protects the monitoring system from the monitored system.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used by observability teams keeping metrics costs sane.

## Features

- **Pipeline**: Three-stage ETL pipeline for topic records.
- `generate_raw` (`generate_raw(seed, n)`): Extract stage: build synthetic raw records.
- `clean_rows` (`clean_rows(rows)`): Transform stage: drop invalid rows, normalize, bucket. Returns (clean_rows, dropped_count).
- `write_csv` (`write_csv(path, rows)`): Load stage: write rows to a CSV file.
- `Pipeline.extract` (`Pipeline.extract(self, n)`): Run the extract stage and return raw rows.
- `Pipeline.transform` (`Pipeline.transform(self, rows)`): Run the transform stage and return (clean, dropped).
- `Pipeline.load` (`Pipeline.load(self, rows)`): Run the load stage; return the CSV path written.
- `Pipeline.run` (`Pipeline.run(self, n)`): Run extract -> transform -> load; print a stage report.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and run the pipeline.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, csv, os, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Extract -> transform -> load over synthetic records. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) across all three stages. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/devops_sre/metrics-cardinality-guard-data_pipeline-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
The pipeline writes demo_workspace/records_clean.csv in the current working directory; use --out-dir to change it.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A stage report table (extracted, dropped, loaded row counts), bucket distribution, five sample rows, and the CSV path.
