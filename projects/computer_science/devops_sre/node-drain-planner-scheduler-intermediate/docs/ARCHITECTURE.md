# Architecture (HLD) — Node Drain Planner: Task Scheduler

## Problem & Users

Node Drain Planner built as a Task scheduler. Draining a node for maintenance evicts pods that must land somewhere with capacity and respect their budgets. The planner sequences drains across nodes, verifying each step keeps services available and capacity sufficient. Maintenance windows stop being scary. Registers interval jobs on a heap scheduler, runs them for a fixed demo duration, and prints the execution log.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (devops_sre) who needs a working, runnable reference for Node Drain Planner — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduler | main | Minimal interval scheduler driven by a heap of next-run times. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
add_job(name, interval, func) -> heap of next-run times
run loop: pop due job -> func(name) -> log entry
         -> push back with next_run + interval
log -> execution table + per-job counts
```

## Storage

In-memory only: the job heap and execution log exist for the run and are not persisted.

## Scaling & Limits

Single-threaded with O(log j) dispatch; suited to lightweight periodic jobs, not to thousands of concurrent or long-running tasks.

## Trade-offs

A heap loop is simple and precise for intervals but single-threaded, so blocking jobs would stall the whole schedule.

## Failure Handling

A job that raises would propagate out of run(); demo jobs are side-effect-light counters, and the loop always exits at the deadline so it cannot hang.
