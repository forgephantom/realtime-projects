# Rollback Decision Engine: Decision Tree Classifier

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** devops_sre | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

Rollback Decision Engine built as a Decision tree classifier. Deciding to roll back under pressure is hard, so the engine scores the decision from live signals. It weighs error-rate deltas, latency regression, and business metrics after a deploy, recommending rollback, hold, or proceed with confidence levels. It removes the 2 AM guesswork. Grows a Gini-based decision tree on seeded synthetic features, prints the tree as text, and reports test accuracy.

**Core concept — Rollback Decision Engine:** Deciding to roll back under pressure is hard, so the engine scores the decision from live signals. It weighs error-rate deltas, latency regression, and business metrics after a deploy, recommending rollback, hold, or proceed with confidence levels. It removes the 2 AM guesswork.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used by SRE teams automating deploy safety.

## Features

- **DecisionTree**: Binary decision tree grown with greedy Gini-impurity splits.
- `gini` (`gini(labels)`): Gini impurity of a label list.
- `majority` (`majority(labels)`): Most common label.
- `accuracy` (`accuracy(y_true, y_pred)`): Fraction of correct predictions.
- `generate_dataset` (`generate_dataset(seed, n)`): Generate 2-feature topic rows with binary labels.
- `DecisionTree.fit` (`DecisionTree.fit(self, X, y)`): Grow the tree from training features X and labels y.
- `DecisionTree.predict` (`DecisionTree.predict(self, X)`): Predict labels for feature vectors X.
- `print_tree` (`print_tree(node, depth=0)`): Print the tree structure as indented text.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, train, print the tree, and report accuracy.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Greedy binary splits maximizing Gini impurity gain. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(d * n^2) worst case to find splits for d features, n rows. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/devops_sre/rollback-decision-engine-decision_tree-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

An indented text rendering of the learned tree followed by the test accuracy line.
