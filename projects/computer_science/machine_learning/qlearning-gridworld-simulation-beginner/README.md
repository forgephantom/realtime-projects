# Q-Learning Gridworld: Simulation (Logistic Growth)

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** machine_learning | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Q-Learning Gridworld built as a Simulation (logistic growth). Q-learning learns action values from experience with the Bellman update, no model needed: epsilon-greedy exploration fills the Q-table and the max over next actions bootstraps values. The gridworld makes policies visible as arrows. Learning rate and discount shape the result. Euler-integrates logistic growth dP/dt = r*P*(1-P/K) and prints the trajectory table with summary statistics.

**Core concept — Q-Learning Gridworld:** Q-learning learns action values from experience with the Bellman update, no model needed: epsilon-greedy exploration fills the Q-table and the max over next actions bootstraps values. The gridworld makes policies visible as arrows. Learning rate and discount shape the result.

**Why this matters in the real world:** The pedagogical RL algorithm; Q-learning variants drive game AI and robotics.

## Features

- `simulate` (`simulate(params, steps, dt)`): Euler-integrate logistic growth; return [(t, value)] rows.
- `print_trajectory` (`print_trajectory(rows, every)`): Print every Nth trajectory row plus the final state.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, simulate, and print the trajectory and summary.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Explicit Euler integration of logistic growth. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(steps). See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/machine_learning/qlearning-gridworld-simulation-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A sampled trajectory table (t, value) plus start, end, peak, and carrying-capacity summary lines.
