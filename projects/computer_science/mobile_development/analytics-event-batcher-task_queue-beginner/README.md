# Analytics Event Batcher: Task Queue

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** mobile_development | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Analytics Event Batcher built as a task queue. Analytics events batch for efficiency with offline storage and upload policies. The batcher queues events flushing on size, time, or connectivity. Insights without battery drain. A multithreaded task queue that fans jobs out to a worker pool and reports per-job timing and result digests.

**Core concept — Analytics Event Batcher:** Analytics events batch for efficiency with offline storage and upload policies. The batcher queues events flushing on size, time, or connectivity. Insights without battery drain.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used in product analytics.

## Features

- **Job**: A unit of work with a numeric id, a kind label, and a payload string.
- **TaskQueue**: Thread-pool queue that runs Jobs on worker threads and records per-job results.
- `TaskQueue.submit` (`submit(self, job: Job) -> None`): Enqueue a Job for the worker threads.
- `TaskQueue.run` (`run(self) -> None`): Start workers, wait until the queue drains, then shut them down.
- `TaskQueue.results` (`results(self) -> list`): Completed (job_id, kind, worker, elapsed_ms, digest) rows sorted by job id.
- `TaskQueue.stats` (`stats(self) -> dict`): Aggregate job count plus total and mean elapsed milliseconds.
- `make_jobs` (`make_jobs(n: int, kinds: list, rng: random.Random) -> list`): Build n demo Job objects with seeded random payloads.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Submit demo jobs, run the queue, print the results table, return exit code.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Thread-pool work queue with a shared queue.Queue and sentinel shutdown. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(1) enqueue/dequeue; wall time scales with jobs/workers. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/mobile_development/analytics-event-batcher-task_queue-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--workers, --jobs, and --kinds override the demo configuration from {'batch': 'size and time triggers', 'store': 'offline queue', 'upload': 'connectivity policy', 'schema': 'event validation'}.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints a per-job table (id, kind, worker, elapsed ms, digest) plus aggregate timing stats.
