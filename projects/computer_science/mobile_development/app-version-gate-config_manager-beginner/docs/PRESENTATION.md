# Presentation Guide — App Version Gate: Config Manager

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a App Version Gate that merges defaults, files, environment, and CLI flags into one validated configuration with full provenance. Old app versions break against new APIs, so gates enforce minimum versions with graceful messaging.

App Version Gate in two sentences: Old app versions break against new APIs, so gates enforce minimum versions with graceful messaging. The gate checks versions against policy with force and soft update paths. Fragmentation gets managed.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: `Config` plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Layered merge: defaults < ini string < environment < CLI, with typed coercion; runs in O(k) over k config keys.
- Honest scaling limit: Flat key/value schema suits service config; deeply nested configs would want a tree model instead.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a App Version Gate in Python with four-layer precedence, typed coercion, per-key source tracking, and schema validation.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** What is the precedence order?

**A:** Later layers win: defaults, then the INI snippet, then PREFIX_* environment variables, then --set overrides.

**Q:** How do you know where a value came from?

**A:** Every set records its layer in _sources, so the demo prints exactly where each value came from.

**Q:** How are booleans parsed?

**A:** Booleans accept true/false/1/0/yes/no/on/off case-insensitively; anything else raises ValueError.
