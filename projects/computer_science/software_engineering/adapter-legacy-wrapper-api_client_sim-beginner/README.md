# Adapter (Legacy Wrapper): Api Client Sim

## Overview

Adapter (Legacy Wrapper) built as a API client sim. Adapters let incompatible interfaces collaborate: a wrapper translates a legacy library's API into the interface new code expects, without touching either side. It is the pragmatic pattern for technical debt: new code stays clean while old code keeps running. Two-way adapters sync both directions. A simulated REST API client that paginates through an in-process fake API, retrying simulated server errors with backoff.

**Core concept — Adapter (Legacy Wrapper):** Adapters let incompatible interfaces collaborate: a wrapper translates a legacy library's API into the interface new code expects, without touching either side. It is the pragmatic pattern for technical debt: new code stays clean while old code keeps running. Two-way adapters sync both directions.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Third-party SDK integrations and database-driver shims universally use adapters.

## Features

- **APIError**: Raised when a simulated request fails after all retries.
- **FakeAPI**: In-process fake HTTP-like API: no sockets, no network; serves paginated items.
- **APIClient**: Tiny REST-style client with retries, pagination helpers, and a request history.
- `FakeAPI.handle` (`handle(self, method: str, path: str, params: dict) -> tuple`): Process one request; return (status_code, body_dict).
- `APIClient.request` (`request(self, method: str, path: str, params: dict = None) -> dict`): Send one request, retrying simulated 500s with a small backoff.
- `APIClient.list_all` (`list_all(self, per_page: int = 5) -> list`): Fetch every page of /items and return the combined item list.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int, per_page: int, max_retries: int) -> int`): Paginate through the fake API (surviving simulated 500s) and report.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Parse flags and run the API client demo.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Paginated fetching with retry-on-500 and linear backoff. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(pages) requests to list all items. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/software_engineering/adapter-legacy-wrapper-api_client_sim-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--per-page and --max-retries tune the demo; item count and simulated failures come from {'legacy': 'legacy interface wrapped', 'target': 'modern interface exposed', 'translate': 'method/parameter mappings'}.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints the fetched item table, a single-item fetch, and the full request history showing retries after simulated 500s.
