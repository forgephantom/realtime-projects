# CQRS (Lite): Rest Api Service

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** software_engineering | **Difficulty:** advanced | **Est. build time:** 8-16 hours

## Overview

CQRS (Lite) built as a REST API service. CQRS separates read and write models: commands mutate through the write model with full validation, queries hit denormalized read models optimized for each view. Event sourcing often pairs with it for the audit trail. The complexity pays off when reads and writes scale differently. Serves a small JSON REST API for the topic records, with health, list, create, and stats endpoints.

**Core concept — CQRS (Lite):** CQRS separates read and write models: commands mutate through the write model with full validation, queries hit denormalized read models optimized for each view. Event sourcing often pairs with it for the audit trail. The complexity pays off when reads and writes scale differently.

**Why this matters in the real world:** High-scale read/write systems (trading, social) separate models with CQRS.

## Features

- **Store**: In-memory record collection backing the API.
- **ApiHandler**: BaseHTTPRequestHandler routing GET/POST to the Store.
- `seed_records` (`seed_records(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic records.
- `Store.list_records` (`Store.list_records(self)`): Return a copy of all stored records.
- `Store.add_record` (`Store.add_record(self, payload)`): Append a record built from the posted JSON payload.
- `Store.stats` (`Store.stats(self)`): Aggregate record count, mean value, and active count.
- `start_server` (`start_server(port, seed, count)`): Bind a ThreadingHTTPServer on 127.0.0.1 and serve it in a thread.
- `run_self_test` (`run_self_test(base_url, seed)`): Exercise every endpoint with urllib and print a results table.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args; self-test by default or serve with --serve.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, http.server, urllib

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around In-memory CRUD over HTTP with JSON bodies. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) per list/stats request, O(1) per create. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/software_engineering/cqrs-lite-rest_api-advanced
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Add --serve to keep the server running instead of self-testing.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A results table with one line per exercised endpoint (method, path, status code, summary) plus a SELF-TEST PASSED/FAILED line.
