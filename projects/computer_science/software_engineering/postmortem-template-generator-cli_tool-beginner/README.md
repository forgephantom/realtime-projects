# Postmortem Template Generator: Command-Line Tool

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** software_engineering | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Postmortem Template Generator built as a Command-line tool. Blameless postmortems learn from incidents: the generator scaffolds timeline, impact, root causes (five whys), and action items with owners from incident data. It enforces blameless language checks. Follow-through tracking closes the loop. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

**Core concept — Postmortem Template Generator:** Blameless postmortems learn from incidents: the generator scaffolds timeline, impact, root causes (five whys), and action items with owners from incident data. It enforces blameless language checks. Follow-through tracking closes the loop.

**Why this matters in the real world:** SRE culture (Google SRE book) runs blameless postmortems with action items.

## Features

- `generate_rows` (`generate_rows(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic topic rows.
- `cmd_summary` (`cmd_summary(rows, args)`): Print per-category counts and value statistics.
- `cmd_top` (`cmd_top(rows, args)`): Print the top-N rows by value.
- `cmd_filter` (`cmd_filter(rows, args)`): Print rows whose value is at least --min-value.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and dispatch to the chosen subcommand.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Deterministic synthetic rows + subcommand dispatch. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate rows; O(n log n) for top-N sort. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/software_engineering/postmortem-template-generator-cli_tool-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Try `python3 src/main.py top --top-n 3`, `python3 src/main.py filter --min-value 900`, or add --json to any command.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

A formatted text table (or JSON with --json) for the summary, top-N, or filter subcommand.
