# Architecture (HLD) — API Versioning Strategies: Api Client Sim

## Problem & Users

API Versioning Strategies built as a API client sim. APIs evolve, and versioning decides how old clients keep working: URL path versions (/v1/), header versions, or content-type negotiation each have fans. The strategy layer routes versioned requests to the right handler set, deprecates old versions with Sunset headers, and tracks usage per version to plan retirements. The hardest part is not the mechanism but the deprecation policy. A simulated REST API client that paginates through an in-process fake API, retrying simulated server errors with backoff.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (web_development) who needs a working, runnable reference for API Versioning Strategies — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| APIError | main | Raised when a simulated request fails after all retries. |
| FakeAPI | main | In-process fake HTTP-like API: no sockets, no network; serves paginated items. |
| APIClient | main | Tiny REST-style client with retries, pagination helpers, and a request history. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
APIClient.list_all -> request per page -> FakeAPI.handle
simulated 500 -> sleep backoff -> retry (up to max_retries)
200 responses -> combined item list + full request history printed
```

## Storage

In-memory only: the fake dataset and request history vanish when the process exits.

## Scaling & Limits

In-process fake: no real HTTP, connection pooling, or TLS; the client logic is what is being demonstrated.

## Trade-offs

A fake in-process API keeps the demo hermetic and fast, at the cost of not exercising real network behavior.

## Failure Handling

Simulated 500s are retried up to max_retries, then APIError is raised with status and body; 404s fail fast with no retry.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
