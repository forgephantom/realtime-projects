# Architecture (HLD) — File Upload Validator: File Organizer

## Problem & Users

File Upload Validator built as a file organizer. File uploads are dangerous because extensions lie: the validator checks magic bytes against the claimed type, enforces size limits, scans for polyglot and double-extension tricks, and stores files outside the web root with random names. Image uploads get re-encoded to strip embedded payloads. Each layer catches what the previous one missed. A file organizer that generates sample files, plans moves by extension mapping, and sorts them into categorized subfolders.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (web_development) who needs a working, runnable reference for File Upload Validator — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| FileOrganizer | main | Sorts the top-level files of a folder into subfolders by extension. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
seeded sample files -> demo_workspace/ (flat)
FileOrganizer.plan -> [(source, dest)] by extension map
FileOrganizer.execute -> shutil.move -> categorized subfolders
before/after trees printed to stdout
```

## Storage

Only the demo_workspace folder it creates at runtime; no state is kept between runs beyond those files.

## Scaling & Limits

Single-machine, single-threaded moves; fine for thousands of files, not a distributed file pipeline.

## Trade-offs

Top-level files only keeps the logic predictable; recursive organizing would risk surprising moves in nested folders.

## Failure Handling

Unknown extensions go to a 'misc' folder instead of erroring; --dry-run prints the plan without moving anything.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
