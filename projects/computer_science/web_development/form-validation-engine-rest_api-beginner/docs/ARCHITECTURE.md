# Architecture (HLD) — Form Validation Engine: Rest Api Service

## Problem & Users

Form Validation Engine built as a REST API service. Server-side validation is the real gatekeeper: the engine declares per-field rules (required, type, length, pattern, cross-field matches), runs them in order, and returns structured per-field errors the UI can render. It distinguishes missing vs malformed vs business-rule failures and never trusts client-side checks. Sanitization runs alongside validation, not instead of it. Serves a small JSON REST API for the topic records, with health, list, create, and stats endpoints.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (web_development) who needs a working, runnable reference for Form Validation Engine — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Store | main | In-memory record collection backing the API. |
| ApiHandler | main | BaseHTTPRequestHandler routing GET/POST to the Store. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
urllib client -> HTTP request -> ApiHandler
ApiHandler -> Store (in-memory list) -> JSON response
Store: list_records / add_record / stats
```

## Storage

In-memory only: records live in a Python list inside the Store and vanish when the process exits. No database or files are used.

## Scaling & Limits

ThreadingHTTPServer handles modest concurrency, but the shared list is not lock-protected and everything is single-process, so this suits local demos, not production traffic.

## Trade-offs

Stdlib-only keeps the template dependency-free, at the cost of hand-rolled routing and no request validation framework.

## Failure Handling

Malformed JSON bodies are treated as empty objects; unknown routes return 404 JSON. The server shuts down cleanly via server.shutdown() after the self-test.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
