# Architecture (HLD) — HTTP Cache Header Advisor: Command-Line Tool

## Problem & Users

HTTP Cache Header Advisor built as a Command-line tool. Cache-Control, Expires, and validators like ETag decide how long browsers and CDNs may reuse a response without asking again. Immutable hashed assets get long max-age with immutable, while personalized HTML gets no-store or short private caching. The advisor inspects a resource's change frequency and personalization to recommend the right header set. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (web_development) who needs a working, runnable reference for HTTP Cache Header Advisor — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
--seed -> generate_rows (synthetic table)
subcommand: summary | top | filter -> formatted table or JSON
```

## Storage

No persistence: rows are regenerated from the seed on every invocation and nothing is written to disk.

## Scaling & Limits

Rows live in a Python list, so memory grows linearly with --rows; fine for tens of thousands of rows on a laptop.

## Trade-offs

Synthetic seeded data keeps the tool self-contained and reproducible, at the cost of not reading real input files.

## Failure Handling

An empty filter result prints a zero-count table rather than erroring; --top-n larger than the row count simply returns all rows.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
