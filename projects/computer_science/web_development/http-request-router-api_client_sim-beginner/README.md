# HTTP Request Router: Api Client Sim

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** web_development | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

HTTP Request Router built as a API client sim. A request router matches an incoming HTTP method and path against registered route patterns and dispatches to the right handler. Patterns support literal segments, named parameters like /users/{id}, and wildcards, with precedence rules so the most specific route wins. It is the dispatch core that every web framework builds its API layer on. A simulated REST API client that paginates through an in-process fake API, retrying simulated server errors with backoff.

**Core concept — HTTP Request Router:** A request router matches an incoming HTTP method and path against registered route patterns and dispatches to the right handler. Patterns support literal segments, named parameters like /users/{id}, and wildcards, with precedence rules so the most specific route wins. It is the dispatch core that every web framework builds its API layer on.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Every web framework (Flask, Express, FastAPI, Rails) ships a router; CDNs and API gateways route at the edge the same way.

## Features

- **APIError**: Raised when a simulated request fails after all retries.
- **FakeAPI**: In-process fake HTTP-like API: no sockets, no network; serves paginated items.
- **APIClient**: Tiny REST-style client with retries, pagination helpers, and a request history.
- `FakeAPI.handle` (`handle(self, method: str, path: str, params: dict) -> tuple`): Process one request; return (status_code, body_dict).
- `APIClient.request` (`request(self, method: str, path: str, params: dict = None) -> dict`): Send one request, retrying simulated 500s with a small backoff.
- `APIClient.list_all` (`list_all(self, per_page: int = 5) -> list`): Fetch every page of /items and return the combined item list.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int, per_page: int, max_retries: int) -> int`): Paginate through the fake API (surviving simulated 500s) and report.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Parse flags and run the API client demo.

| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Paginated fetching with retry-on-500 and linear backoff. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(pages) requests to list all items. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/web_development/http-request-router-api_client_sim-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--per-page and --max-retries tune the demo; item count and simulated failures come from {'routes': 'list of (method, pattern, handler) registrations', 'precedence': 'static segment > named parameter > wildcard', 'not_found_policy': '404 vs 405 behavior when path or method misses'}.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints the fetched item table, a single-item fetch, and the full request history showing retries after simulated 500s.
