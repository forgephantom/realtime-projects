# HTTP Status Code Playground: Api Client Sim

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** web_development | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

HTTP Status Code Playground built as a API client sim. Status codes are a compact contract: 2xx means the server did what was asked, 3xx redirects, 4xx blames the client, 5xx blames the server. Choosing precisely (201 vs 200, 404 vs 410, 409 vs 422) tells clients whether to retry, fix input, or give up. This playground maps everyday API outcomes to the correct code and reason phrase. A simulated REST API client that paginates through an in-process fake API, retrying simulated server errors with backoff.

**Core concept — HTTP Status Code Playground:** Status codes are a compact contract: 2xx means the server did what was asked, 3xx redirects, 4xx blames the client, 5xx blames the server. Choosing precisely (201 vs 200, 404 vs 410, 409 vs 422) tells clients whether to retry, fix input, or give up. This playground maps everyday API outcomes to the correct code and reason phrase.

**Why this matters in the real world:** API design guides and gateway error mapping at companies like Stripe and Twilio standardize on precise status semantics.

## Features

- **APIError**: Raised when a simulated request fails after all retries.
- **FakeAPI**: In-process fake HTTP-like API: no sockets, no network; serves paginated items.
- **APIClient**: Tiny REST-style client with retries, pagination helpers, and a request history.
- `FakeAPI.handle` (`handle(self, method: str, path: str, params: dict) -> tuple`): Process one request; return (status_code, body_dict).
- `APIClient.request` (`request(self, method: str, path: str, params: dict = None) -> dict`): Send one request, retrying simulated 500s with a small backoff.
- `APIClient.list_all` (`list_all(self, per_page: int = 5) -> list`): Fetch every page of /items and return the combined item list.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int, per_page: int, max_retries: int) -> int`): Paginate through the fake API (surviving simulated 500s) and report.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Parse flags and run the API client demo.

## How It Works

The project is built around Paginated fetching with retry-on-500 and linear backoff. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(pages) requests to list all items. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/web_development/http-status-code-playground-api_client_sim-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--per-page and --max-retries tune the demo; item count and simulated failures come from {'scenario_catalog': 'named scenarios like duplicate-create or stale-write', 'retry_advice': 'whether each code implies retry, fix, or abort', 'strictness': 'lenient 200-with-error-body vs strict code usage'}.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints the fetched item table, a single-item fetch, and the full request history showing retries after simulated 500s.
