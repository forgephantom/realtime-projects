# Login Attempt Throttler: Rate Limiter

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** web_development | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

Login Attempt Throttler built as a rate limiter. Brute-force login attacks try thousands of password guesses, so throttling slows them down: failed attempts per account and per IP accumulate, triggering growing delays, CAPTCHAs, or temporary lockouts. The design must not let attackers lock out legitimate users or enumerate which accounts exist. Exponential backoff per source balances security with usability. A token-bucket rate limiter that refills continuously over time and reports allow/deny decisions for a scripted request schedule.

**Core concept — Login Attempt Throttler:** Brute-force login attacks try thousands of password guesses, so throttling slows them down: failed attempts per account and per IP accumulate, triggering growing delays, CAPTCHAs, or temporary lockouts. The design must not let attackers lock out legitimate users or enumerate which accounts exist. Exponential backoff per source balances security with usability.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Every major login system (Google, GitHub, banks) throttles attempts; OWASP lists it as essential authentication control.

## Features

- **FakeClock**: Deterministic clock for the demo: time moves only when advance() is called.
- **TokenBucket**: Token-bucket rate limiter with continuous refill and an injectable clock.
- `FakeClock.advance` (`advance(self, dt: float) -> None`): Move the fake clock forward by dt seconds.
- `TokenBucket.peek` (`peek(self) -> float`): Tokens currently available, after refilling up to now.
- `TokenBucket.allow` (`allow(self) -> bool`): Consume one token if available; True means allowed, False denied.
- `TokenBucket.stats` (`stats(self) -> dict`): Allowed/denied counters and the admission rate.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int, rate: float, capacity: int, n_requests: int) -> int`): Replay a seeded bursty arrival schedule against the bucket and print decisions.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Parse flags and run the rate-limiter demo, returning the exit code.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Token bucket with continuous time-based refill. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(1) per allow() call. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/web_development/login-attempt-throttler-rate_limiter-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--rate, --capacity, and --requests override the demo configuration from {'max_attempts': 'failures before throttle engages', 'lockout_minutes': 'lockout duration', 'per_ip_vs_account': 'which dimensions are tracked'}.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

Prints a per-request table (request number, timestamp, tokens, ALLOW/DENY) plus the admission-rate summary.
