# Architecture (HLD) — OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow Simulator: Encryption Tool

## Problem & Users

OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow Simulator built as a Encryption tool. OAuth2 lets users grant a third-party app limited access without sharing passwords: the app redirects to the provider, the user approves scopes, and the provider returns an authorization code that the app exchanges for tokens. PKCE adds a code challenge so mobile apps can do this without a client secret. Simulating all four roles (user, client, auth server, resource server) shows where each secret must live. Encrypts and decrypts data with a hand-written XOR stream cipher using a SHA-256 counter-mode keystream.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (web_development) who needs a working, runnable reference for OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow Simulator — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| StreamCipher | main | XOR stream cipher over a SHA-256 counter-mode keystream. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
--key or --seed -> derive_key (SHA-256)
key + counter -> keystream (SHA-256 blocks)
plaintext XOR keystream -> ciphertext hex
ciphertext XOR keystream -> plaintext (round trip)
```

## Storage

In-memory only: keys, keystream, and messages exist for the run; nothing is written to disk.

## Scaling & Limits

Keystream generation is O(n) in message length with small constant overhead; fine for kilobyte-to-megabyte demo payloads.

## Trade-offs

A raw stream cipher is simple and dependency-free but provides no authentication; real use would need an AEAD construction.

## Failure Handling

Decryption with the wrong key or corrupted hex yields garbage rather than an error, which is expected for a raw stream cipher with no authentication tag; --decrypt validates hex before decoding.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
