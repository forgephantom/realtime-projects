# Password Hashing with PBKDF2: Command-Line Tool

**Domain:** computer_science | **Subdomain:** web_development | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

Password Hashing with PBKDF2 built as a Command-line tool. Passwords must never be stored reversibly: PBKDF2 stretches a password with a random salt through many HMAC iterations so each guess costs real work. The stored record keeps algorithm, iteration count, salt, and hash, letting the server raise iterations as hardware improves. Constant-time comparison and per-user salts defeat rainbow tables and timing probes. A subcommand CLI that generates seeded synthetic topic rows and reports summaries, top-N rows, or filtered rows as tables or JSON.

**Core concept — Password Hashing with PBKDF2:** Passwords must never be stored reversibly: PBKDF2 stretches a password with a random salt through many HMAC iterations so each guess costs real work. The stored record keeps algorithm, iteration count, salt, and hash, letting the server raise iterations as hardware improves. Constant-time comparison and per-user salts defeat rainbow tables and timing probes.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Django, passlib, and NIST 800-63 guidance recommend salted, iterated hashing (PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2).

## Features

- `generate_rows` (`generate_rows(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic topic rows.
- `cmd_summary` (`cmd_summary(rows, args)`): Print per-category counts and value statistics.
- `cmd_top` (`cmd_top(rows, args)`): Print the top-N rows by value.
- `cmd_filter` (`cmd_filter(rows, args)`): Print rows whose value is at least --min-value.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and dispatch to the chosen subcommand.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Deterministic synthetic rows + subcommand dispatch. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate rows; O(n log n) for top-N sort. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/web_development/password-hashing-pbkdf2-cli_tool-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Try `python3 src/main.py top --top-n 3`, `python3 src/main.py filter --min-value 900`, or add --json to any command.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

A formatted text table (or JSON with --json) for the summary, top-N, or filter subcommand.
