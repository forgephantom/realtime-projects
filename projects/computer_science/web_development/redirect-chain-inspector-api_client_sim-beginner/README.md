# Redirect Chain Inspector: Api Client Sim

## Overview

Redirect Chain Inspector built as a API client sim. Redirect chains slow pages and leak link equity: the inspector follows each URL's redirects, records status codes and latency per hop, and flags chains, loops, and mixed http/https hops. It reports the final destination and total added latency. One hop is ideal; more than three is a fix ticket. A simulated REST API client that paginates through an in-process fake API, retrying simulated server errors with backoff.

**Core concept — Redirect Chain Inspector:** Redirect chains slow pages and leak link equity: the inspector follows each URL's redirects, records status codes and latency per hop, and flags chains, loops, and mixed http/https hops. It reports the final destination and total added latency. One hop is ideal; more than three is a fix ticket.

**Why this matters in the real world:** SEO audits and site migrations use redirect inspection to preserve rankings during URL changes.

## Features

- **APIError**: Raised when a simulated request fails after all retries.
- **FakeAPI**: In-process fake HTTP-like API: no sockets, no network; serves paginated items.
- **APIClient**: Tiny REST-style client with retries, pagination helpers, and a request history.
- `FakeAPI.handle` (`handle(self, method: str, path: str, params: dict) -> tuple`): Process one request; return (status_code, body_dict).
- `APIClient.request` (`request(self, method: str, path: str, params: dict = None) -> dict`): Send one request, retrying simulated 500s with a small backoff.
- `APIClient.list_all` (`list_all(self, per_page: int = 5) -> list`): Fetch every page of /items and return the combined item list.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int, per_page: int, max_retries: int) -> int`): Paginate through the fake API (surviving simulated 500s) and report.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Parse flags and run the API client demo.

## How It Works

The project is built around Paginated fetching with retry-on-500 and linear backoff. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(pages) requests to list all items. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/computer_science/web_development/redirect-chain-inspector-api_client_sim-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--per-page and --max-retries tune the demo; item count and simulated failures come from {'max_hops': 'follow limit before abort', 'timeout': 'per-hop timeout seconds', 'flag_mixed': 'whether http/https mixing is flagged'}.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints the fetched item table, a single-item fetch, and the full request history showing retries after simulated 500s.
