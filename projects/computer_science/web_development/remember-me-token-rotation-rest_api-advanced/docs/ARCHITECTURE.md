# Architecture (HLD) — Remember-Me Token Rotation: Rest Api Service

## Problem & Users

Remember-Me Token Rotation built as a REST API service. Remember-me cookies trade convenience for risk, so secure designs use rotating token series: a persistent series id plus a one-time token, where each use issues a fresh token and invalidates the old one. If a stolen token is replayed, the series mismatch reveals theft and the whole series is revoked. This gives long-lived login with theft detection built in. Serves a small JSON REST API for the topic records, with health, list, create, and stats endpoints.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in computer_science (web_development) who needs a working, runnable reference for Remember-Me Token Rotation — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Store | main | In-memory record collection backing the API. |
| ApiHandler | main | BaseHTTPRequestHandler routing GET/POST to the Store. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
urllib client -> HTTP request -> ApiHandler
ApiHandler -> Store (in-memory list) -> JSON response
Store: list_records / add_record / stats
```

## Storage

In-memory only: records live in a Python list inside the Store and vanish when the process exits. No database or files are used.

## Scaling & Limits

ThreadingHTTPServer handles modest concurrency, but the shared list is not lock-protected and everything is single-process, so this suits local demos, not production traffic.

## Trade-offs

Stdlib-only keeps the template dependency-free, at the cost of hand-rolled routing and no request validation framework.

## Failure Handling

Malformed JSON bodies are treated as empty objects; unknown routes return 404 JSON. The server shuts down cleanly via server.shutdown() after the self-test.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
