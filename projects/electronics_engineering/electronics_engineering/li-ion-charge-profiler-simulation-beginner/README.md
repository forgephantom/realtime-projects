# Li-Ion Charge Profiler: Simulation (Logistic Growth)

**Domain:** electronics_engineering | **Subdomain:** electronics_engineering | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Li-Ion Charge Profiler built as a Simulation (logistic growth). Lithium-ion charging runs constant current until the cell nears full voltage, then constant voltage while current tapers, with temperature and C-rate limits guarding safety. Euler-integrates logistic growth dP/dt = r*P*(1-P/K) and prints the trajectory table with summary statistics.

**Core concept — Li-Ion Charge Profiler:** Lithium-ion charging runs constant current until the cell nears full voltage, then constant voltage while current tapers, with temperature and C-rate limits guarding safety.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used to set charger IC parameters and estimate charge time for battery products.

## Features

- `simulate` (`simulate(params, steps, dt)`): Euler-integrate logistic growth; return [(t, value)] rows.
- `print_trajectory` (`print_trajectory(rows, every)`): Print every Nth trajectory row plus the final state.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, simulate, and print the trajectory and summary.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Explicit Euler integration of logistic growth. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(steps). See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/electronics_engineering/electronics_engineering/li-ion-charge-profiler-simulation-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A sampled trajectory table (t, value) plus start, end, peak, and carrying-capacity summary lines.
