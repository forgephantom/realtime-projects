# Architecture (HLD) — Logic Gate Simulator: Simulation (Logistic Growth)

## Problem & Users

Logic Gate Simulator built as a Simulation (logistic growth). Every logic gate has a truth table: AND needs all inputs high, OR needs any, XOR needs an odd count, and NOT flips its input. Chaining gates builds adders, multiplexers, and eventually whole processors from these primitives. Euler-integrates logistic growth dP/dt = r*P*(1-P/K) and prints the trajectory table with summary statistics.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in electronics_engineering (electronics_engineering) who needs a working, runnable reference for Logic Gate Simulator — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
PARAMS (r, K, P0) + --steps/--dt -> simulate (Euler loop)
trajectory rows -> print_trajectory (sampled table)
rows -> start/end/peak summary
```

## Storage

In-memory only: the trajectory list exists for the run and is not persisted.

## Scaling & Limits

The trajectory is a plain list, so millions of steps would use noticeable memory; streaming or downsampling would fix that.

## Trade-offs

Explicit Euler is the simplest integrator to read and verify, at the cost of accuracy versus higher-order methods for stiff dynamics.

## Failure Handling

A non-positive carrying capacity K would flip the growth sign; the template documents K as positive and the default params keep it well-behaved.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
