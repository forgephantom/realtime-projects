# Thermistor Temperature Converter: Unit Converter

**Domain:** electronics_engineering | **Subdomain:** electronics_engineering | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

Thermistor Temperature Converter built as a unit converter. An NTC thermistor's resistance drops exponentially with temperature, and the Steinhart-Hart equation converts that resistance to temperature with three calibration coefficients. The converter also handles the simpler beta-parameter model used on many datasheets. A unit converter covering length, mass, volume, speed, data sizes, and temperature, with real conversion factors and offset-aware temperature math.

**Core concept — Thermistor Temperature Converter:** An NTC thermistor's resistance drops exponentially with temperature, and the Steinhart-Hart equation converts that resistance to temperature with three calibration coefficients. The converter also handles the simpler beta-parameter model used on many datasheets.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Battery packs, 3D printers, and HVAC systems read temperature through NTC thermistors.

## Features

- **UnitConverter**: Converts between units within a category using factor tables; temperature is offset-aware.
- `UnitConverter.convert` (`convert(self, value: float, from_unit: str, to_unit: str) -> float`): Convert value from from_unit to to_unit; raises ValueError on misuse.
- `UnitConverter.categories` (`categories(self) -> list`): Category names, including temperature.
- `UnitConverter.units` (`units(self, category: str) -> list`): Unit names for a category.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int) -> int`): Convert the seeded demo list and print a results table.
- `run_single` (`run_single(value: float, from_unit: str, to_unit: str) -> int`): Convert one value supplied on the command line.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Demo table by default; single conversion with --value/--from/--to.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Factor-to-base-unit tables; temperature via to/from-Celsius functions. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(1) per conversion. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/electronics_engineering/electronics_engineering/thermistor-temperature-converter-unit_converter-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--value/--from/--to converts a single value; the default run prints the demo conversion table.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

Prints a conversion results table (value, from, to, result) and the supported category list.
