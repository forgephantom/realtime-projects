# Soil Erosion Estimator (USLE): Decision Tree Classifier

**Domain:** environmental_science | **Subdomain:** environmental_science | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

---

## Overview

Soil Erosion Estimator (USLE) built as a Decision tree classifier. The Universal Soil Loss Equation multiplies rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope, cover, and practice factors into tons of soil lost per acre per year. The estimator shows which factor dominates so conservation targets the right lever. Grows a Gini-based decision tree on seeded synthetic features, prints the tree as text, and reports test accuracy.

**Core concept — Soil Erosion Estimator (USLE):** The Universal Soil Loss Equation multiplies rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope, cover, and practice factors into tons of soil lost per acre per year. The estimator shows which factor dominates so conservation targets the right lever.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Conservation planners use USLE to justify terracing and cover crops.

## Features

- **DecisionTree**: Binary decision tree grown with greedy Gini-impurity splits.
- `gini` (`gini(labels)`): Gini impurity of a label list.
- `majority` (`majority(labels)`): Most common label.
- `accuracy` (`accuracy(y_true, y_pred)`): Fraction of correct predictions.
- `generate_dataset` (`generate_dataset(seed, n)`): Generate 2-feature topic rows with binary labels.
- `DecisionTree.fit` (`DecisionTree.fit(self, X, y)`): Grow the tree from training features X and labels y.
- `DecisionTree.predict` (`DecisionTree.predict(self, X)`): Predict labels for feature vectors X.
- `print_tree` (`print_tree(node, depth=0)`): Print the tree structure as indented text.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args, train, print the tree, and report accuracy.

## How It Works

The project is built around Greedy binary splits maximizing Gini impurity gain. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(d * n^2) worst case to find splits for d features, n rows. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/environmental_science/environmental_science/usle-erosion-estimator-decision_tree-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

An indented text rendering of the learned tree followed by the test accuracy line.
