# Wind Resource Assessor: Statistical Analyzer

## Overview

Wind Resource Assessor built as a Statistical analyzer. Wind resource assessment fits measured wind speeds to a Weibull distribution, because energy scales with the cube of wind speed and the distribution's shape. The assessor converts a year of anemometer data into expected turbine output. Draws a seeded synthetic sample and reports count, mean, median, stdev, quartiles, and an ASCII histogram.

**Core concept — Wind Resource Assessor:** Wind resource assessment fits measured wind speeds to a Weibull distribution, because energy scales with the cube of wind speed and the distribution's shape. The assessor converts a year of anemometer data into expected turbine output.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Wind farm developers screen sites with resource assessments before installing met towers.

## Features

- `generate_sample` (`generate_sample(seed, n)`): Draw synthetic topic measurements (mixture model).
- `percentile` (`percentile(sorted_vals, q)`): Linear-interpolation percentile of a pre-sorted list.
- `summarize` (`summarize(values, bins)`): Compute a full descriptive-statistics summary.
- `print_report` (`print_report(summary)`): Print the summary table and ASCII histogram.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and print the report.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, random

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |

| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Descriptive statistics with linear-interpolation percentiles. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n log n) for the sort; O(n) for the histogram pass. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/environmental_science/environmental_science/wind-resource-assessor-statistical_analyzer-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

A statistics table (count, mean, median, stdev, min, p25, p75, max) followed by an ASCII histogram.
