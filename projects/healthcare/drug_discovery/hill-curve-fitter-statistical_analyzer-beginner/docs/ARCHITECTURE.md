# Architecture (HLD) — Hill Equation Curve Fitter: Statistical Analyzer

## Problem & Users

Hill Equation Curve Fitter built as a Statistical analyzer. The Hill equation describes sigmoidal dose-response with four parameters: bottom and top asymptotes, the EC50 midpoint, and the Hill slope controlling steepness. Nonlinear least squares fits these parameters to measured responses across a dose series. Recovering known parameters from noisy synthetic data validates the fitting routine. Draws a seeded synthetic sample and reports count, mean, median, stdev, quartiles, and an ASCII histogram.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in healthcare (drug_discovery) who needs a working, runnable reference for Hill Equation Curve Fitter — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
--seed -> generate_sample (mixture model)
sample -> summarize (sort, moments, percentiles, histogram)
summary -> print_report (table + ASCII histogram)
```

## Storage

In-memory only: the sample and summary exist for the duration of the run and nothing is persisted.

## Scaling & Limits

The sample is sorted in memory, so multi-million-point samples would need a streaming quantile sketch instead.

## Trade-offs

Hand-rolled statistics avoid dependencies but only cover univariate descriptives, not hypothesis tests or modeling.

## Failure Handling

An empty sample cannot occur (n comes from --samples), and a constant sample degrades gracefully to a single non-empty histogram bin.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
