# Hill Equation Curve Fitter: Web Dashboard

**Domain:** healthcare | **Subdomain:** drug_discovery | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

---

## Overview

Hill Equation Curve Fitter built as a Web dashboard. The Hill equation describes sigmoidal dose-response with four parameters: bottom and top asymptotes, the EC50 midpoint, and the Hill slope controlling steepness. Nonlinear least squares fits these parameters to measured responses across a dose series. Recovering known parameters from noisy synthetic data validates the fitting routine. Serves a single-page HTML dashboard of topic metrics plus a JSON metrics endpoint.

**Core concept — Hill Equation Curve Fitter:** The Hill equation describes sigmoidal dose-response with four parameters: bottom and top asymptotes, the EC50 midpoint, and the Hill slope controlling steepness. Nonlinear least squares fits these parameters to measured responses across a dose series. Recovering known parameters from noisy synthetic data validates the fitting routine.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Pharmacologists fit Hill curves to quantify drug potency.

## Features

- **DashboardHandler**: Serves the dashboard HTML page and a JSON metrics endpoint.
- `metric_rows` (`metric_rows(seed, count)`): Generate deterministic synthetic metric rows.
- `render_page` (`render_page(seed, count)`): Render the full dashboard HTML page.
- `start_server` (`start_server(port, seed, count)`): Bind a ThreadingHTTPServer on 127.0.0.1 and serve it in a thread.
- `run_self_test` (`run_self_test(base_url, seed, count)`): Fetch the page and metrics endpoint; print a verification summary.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args; self-test by default or serve with --serve.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.8+, stdlib: argparse, json, http.server, urllib

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

---

## How It Works

The project is built around Server-side HTML rendering of a metrics table. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to render n metric rows. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/healthcare/drug_discovery/hill-curve-fitter-web_dashboard-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
Add --serve to keep the dashboard running instead of self-testing.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Status lines for GET / and GET /api/metrics, a five-row metric sample, and a SELF-TEST PASSED/FAILED line.
