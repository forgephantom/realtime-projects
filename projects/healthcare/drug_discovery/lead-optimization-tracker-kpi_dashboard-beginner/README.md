# Lead Optimization Tracker: Kpi_Dashboard

**Domain:** healthcare | **Subdomain:** drug_discovery | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Lead Optimization Tracker built as a kpi_dashboard. Lead optimization improves potency, selectivity, and developability across analog series, tracking multiple properties per compound over time. Pareto-front analysis identifies compounds where no property can improve without hurting another. A tracker that visualizes these trajectories helps teams decide which series to advance. A KPI dashboard that computes growth rate, churn, CAC, and LTV from seeded synthetic business data and renders an ASCII dashboard with sparklines.

**Core concept — Lead Optimization Tracker:** Lead optimization improves potency, selectivity, and developability across analog series, tracking multiple properties per compound over time. Pareto-front analysis identifies compounds where no property can improve without hurting another. A tracker that visualizes these trajectories helps teams decide which series to advance.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Medicinal chemistry teams track multi-parameter optimization toward candidates.

## Features

- `generate_business_data` (`generate_business_data(seed: int, months: int = 12) -> dict`): Seeded 12-month synthetic series: revenue, users, adds, churn, spend.
- `compute_kpis` (`compute_kpis(data: dict) -> dict`): Growth rate, churn rate, CAC, and LTV from the series.
- `sparkline` (`sparkline(values: list) -> str`): Map a numeric series to unicode block sparkline characters.
- `render_dashboard` (`render_dashboard(data: dict, kpis: dict) -> str`): Format the KPI values and sparklines as an ASCII dashboard.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int) -> int`): Seeded demo: generate data, compute KPIs, print the dashboard.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Entry point: seeded KPI dashboard demo.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Seeded geometric-growth business series; KPIs from period ratios: growth, churn, CAC, and LTV from ARPU over churn.. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(M) over M months of synthetic data; all KPI math is O(1) on aggregates.. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/healthcare/drug_discovery/lead-optimization-tracker-kpi_dashboard-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--months sets the synthetic history length; values are seeded and reproducible.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints an ASCII dashboard box with four KPIs, monthly revenue/user sparklines, and the raw monthly table.
