# Virtual Screening Pipeline: Report Generator

**Domain:** healthcare | **Subdomain:** drug_discovery | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Virtual Screening Pipeline built as a report generator. A virtual screening funnel narrows millions of compounds through stages: property filters, similarity to known actives, then expensive scoring. Each stage trades throughput against accuracy, and the enrichment factor measures how much better than random the funnel performs. Planted actives in a synthetic library let developers measure enrichment directly. A report generator that builds seeded synthetic data, aggregates it, and writes a Markdown report with summary and per-service tables.

**Core concept — Virtual Screening Pipeline:** A virtual screening funnel narrows millions of compounds through stages: property filters, similarity to known actives, then expensive scoring. Each stage trades throughput against accuracy, and the enrichment factor measures how much better than random the funnel performs. Planted actives in a synthetic library let developers measure enrichment directly.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Screening funnels narrow millions of compounds down to testable hits.

## Features

- `generate_records` (`generate_records(n: int, rng: random.Random) -> list`): Build n seeded synthetic measurement records for the demo.
- `summarize` (`summarize(records: list) -> dict`): Aggregate totals, per-service rollups, error rate, and latency peaks.
- `render_markdown` (`render_markdown(title: str, summary: dict, records: list) -> str`): Render the summary and sample rows as a Markdown document.
- `write_report` (`write_report(path: str, text: str) -> str`): Write the Markdown report, creating parent folders; return the path.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int, n_rows: int, out_path: str) -> int`): Generate data, summarize it, write the report, print a summary.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Parse flags and run the report demo.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Seeded synthetic data generation, aggregation rollups, Markdown rendering. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(n) to generate and summarize n records. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/healthcare/drug_discovery/virtual-screening-pipeline-report_generator-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--rows sets the record count; --out sets the report path (default ./demo_output/report.md); --title sets the heading.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints aggregate stats to stdout and writes a Markdown report with summary, per-service, and sample-row tables.
