# BMI Trend Tracker: Unit Converter

**Domain:** healthcare | **Subdomain:** health_informatics | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

BMI Trend Tracker built as a unit converter. A personal health log that stores dated height and weight entries and computes body mass index for each, plotting the trend over time. It classifies each reading into standard adult BMI bands and reports the direction and rate of change. The tool is educational and never gives medical advice. A unit converter covering length, mass, volume, speed, data sizes, and temperature, with real conversion factors and offset-aware temperature math.

**Core concept — BMI Trend Tracker:** A personal health log that stores dated height and weight entries and computes body mass index for each, plotting the trend over time. It classifies each reading into standard adult BMI bands and reports the direction and rate of change. The tool is educational and never gives medical advice.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Used in wellness apps and health-education programs as a simple self-monitoring example.

## Features

- **UnitConverter**: Converts between units within a category using factor tables; temperature is offset-aware.
- `UnitConverter.convert` (`convert(self, value: float, from_unit: str, to_unit: str) -> float`): Convert value from from_unit to to_unit; raises ValueError on misuse.
- `UnitConverter.categories` (`categories(self) -> list`): Category names, including temperature.
- `UnitConverter.units` (`units(self, category: str) -> list`): Unit names for a category.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int) -> int`): Convert the seeded demo list and print a results table.
- `run_single` (`run_single(value: float, from_unit: str, to_unit: str) -> int`): Convert one value supplied on the command line.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Demo table by default; single conversion with --value/--from/--to.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Factor-to-base-unit tables; temperature via to/from-Celsius functions. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(1) per conversion. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/healthcare/health_informatics/bmi-trend-tracker-unit_converter-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--value/--from/--to converts a single value; the default run prints the demo conversion table.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

---

## Sample Output

Prints a conversion results table (value, from, to, result) and the supported category list.
