# Architecture (HLD) — Medical Equipment Tracking Board: Lru Cache

## Problem & Users

Medical Equipment Tracking Board built as a LRU cache. An asset-location board for synthetic mobile equipment like infusion pumps and wheelchairs, tracking which unit holds each item and its clean or dirty status. It flags units hoarding equipment and lists items due for preventive maintenance. All assets are fictional. A fixed-capacity LRU cache that evicts the least-recently-used entry and reports hit, miss, and eviction statistics.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in healthcare (health_informatics) who needs a working, runnable reference for Medical Equipment Tracking Board — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| LRUCache | main | Fixed-capacity cache with least-recently-used eviction backed by an OrderedDict. |
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
seeded key stream -> get/put -> OrderedDict (recency order)
over-capacity put -> popitem(last=False) evicts LRU key
hits/misses/evictions -> stats() -> printed trace + summary
```

## Storage

In-memory only: the cache and its counters live in the process and vanish on exit; no disk persistence.

## Scaling & Limits

Single-process structure; capacity is bounded by RAM and there is no sharding or cross-process sharing.

## Trade-offs

OrderedDict gives simple O(1) LRU ordering at the cost of per-entry overhead versus a plain dict with manual timestamps.

## Failure Handling

Capacity below 1 raises ValueError at construction; get() on a missing key returns None instead of raising.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
