# Bed Occupancy Forecaster: Kpi_Dashboard

**Domain:** healthcare | **Subdomain:** hospital_operations | **Difficulty:** intermediate | **Est. build time:** 4-8 hours

## Overview

Bed Occupancy Forecaster built as a kpi_dashboard. Occupancy forecasting predicts bed demand from admission trends, seasonal patterns, and scheduled procedures, so capacity plans stay ahead of surges. Probabilistic forecasts with prediction intervals beat point estimates for staffing decisions. Synthetic occupancy series with known seasonality verify the forecast accuracy. A KPI dashboard that computes growth rate, churn, CAC, and LTV from seeded synthetic business data and renders an ASCII dashboard with sparklines.

**Core concept — Bed Occupancy Forecaster:** Occupancy forecasting predicts bed demand from admission trends, seasonal patterns, and scheduled procedures, so capacity plans stay ahead of surges. Probabilistic forecasts with prediction intervals beat point estimates for staffing decisions. Synthetic occupancy series with known seasonality verify the forecast accuracy.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Occupancy forecasts let hospitals staff up before demand surges.

## Features

- `generate_business_data` (`generate_business_data(seed: int, months: int = 12) -> dict`): Seeded 12-month synthetic series: revenue, users, adds, churn, spend.
- `compute_kpis` (`compute_kpis(data: dict) -> dict`): Growth rate, churn rate, CAC, and LTV from the series.
- `sparkline` (`sparkline(values: list) -> str`): Map a numeric series to unicode block sparkline characters.
- `render_dashboard` (`render_dashboard(data: dict, kpis: dict) -> str`): Format the KPI values and sparklines as an ASCII dashboard.
- `run_demo` (`run_demo(seed: int) -> int`): Seeded demo: generate data, compute KPIs, print the dashboard.
- `build_parser` (`build_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser`): Build the command-line parser for the demo.
- `main` (`main(argv=None) -> int`): Entry point: seeded KPI dashboard demo.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |

| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Seeded geometric-growth business series; KPIs from period ratios: growth, churn, CAC, and LTV from ARPU over churn.. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(M) over M months of synthetic data; all KPI math is O(1) on aggregates.. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/healthcare/hospital_operations/bed-occupancy-forecaster-kpi_dashboard-intermediate
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```
--months sets the synthetic history length; values are seeded and reproducible.

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

Prints an ASCII dashboard box with four KPIs, monthly revenue/user sparklines, and the raw monthly table.
