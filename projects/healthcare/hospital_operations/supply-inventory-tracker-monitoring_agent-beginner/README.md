# Supply Inventory Tracker: Monitoring Agent

**Domain:** healthcare | **Subdomain:** hospital_operations | **Difficulty:** beginner | **Est. build time:** 2-4 hours

## Overview

Supply Inventory Tracker built as a Monitoring agent. Hospital supply tracking monitors stock levels, expiration dates, and par levels across storerooms, flagging items below reorder points. Lot tracking supports recalls when a defective batch is identified. Synthetic inventories with known stock movements verify the tracking and alerting logic. Samples synthetic topic metrics for N cycles, evaluates each reading against thresholds, prints readings and alerts.

**Core concept — Supply Inventory Tracker:** Hospital supply tracking monitors stock levels, expiration dates, and par levels across storerooms, flagging items below reorder points. Lot tracking supports recalls when a defective batch is identified. Synthetic inventories with known stock movements verify the tracking and alerting logic.

**Why this matters in the real world:** Inventory tracking prevents stockouts of critical medical supplies.

## Features

- **Monitor**: Samples metrics, evaluates thresholds, and collects alerts.
- `read_metrics` (`read_metrics(rng, cycle)`): Sample one synthetic topic metric reading.
- `check_thresholds` (`check_thresholds(reading, thresholds)`): Return a list of alert strings for readings over threshold.
- `Monitor.run` (`Monitor.run(self, cycles, interval)`): Sample `cycles` readings, print them, return alert count.
- `main` (`main()`): Parse args and run the monitor.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| src/main.py | CLI entrypoint (argument parsing + demo orchestration) |

## How It Works

The project is built around Periodic sampling with static threshold evaluation. Input data flows from src/main.py through the processing modules, and the overall approach runs in O(cycles) total; O(1) per sample. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the high-level design and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the detailed module breakdown.

## How to Run

```
cd projects/healthcare/hospital_operations/supply-inventory-tracker-monitoring_agent-beginner
python3 src/main.py --help
python3 src/main.py
```

All flags are documented in the CLI itself — run with `--help` to see every option with its default value and meaning.

## Sample Output

One line per cycle (cpu, memory, latency) with ALERT lines for threshold breaches, plus a cycle/alert summary.
