# Presentation Guide — GAD-7-Style Self-Assessment Scorer: Report Generator

## 60-Second Pitch

I built a GAD-7-Style Self-Assessment Scorer that turns raw measurements into a readable Markdown report with summaries you can actually act on. Anxiety screening questionnaires follow the same structure as depression screens: frequency-rated items summed into a total with severity bands.

GAD-7-Style Self-Assessment Scorer in two sentences: Anxiety screening questionnaires follow the same structure as depression screens: frequency-rated items summed into a total with severity bands. The tool is strictly educational, showing how scoring works on synthetic data while making clear that results are not a diagnosis. Disclaimer text accompanies every result screen. Includes prominent disclaimer text that the tool is for wellness self-tracking and screening only, never a diagnosis, and encourages consulting a professional.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Seeded synthetic data generation, aggregation rollups, Markdown rendering; runs in O(n) to generate and summarize n records.
- Honest scaling limit: Holds all records in memory; millions of rows would want streaming aggregation instead.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a GAD-7-Style Self-Assessment Scorer in Python that aggregates seeded measurement data into summary tables and emits a Markdown report.

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** What aggregations does it compute?

**A:** summarize() rolls up requests, errors, and max p99 latency per service, plus overall totals and the error rate.

**Q:** Is the data real?

**A:** A seeded RNG produces the same dataset on every run, so the report is reproducible byte-for-byte for a given seed.

**Q:** What would change for production data?

**A:** The generator hardcodes a small service list and date window; a real version would read from logs or a database.
