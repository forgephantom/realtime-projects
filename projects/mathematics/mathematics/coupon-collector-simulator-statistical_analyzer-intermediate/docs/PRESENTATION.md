# Presentation Guide — Coupon Collector Simulator: Statistical Analyzer

## 60-Second Pitch

A Coupon Collector Simulator statistics tool that turns a seeded synthetic sample into a full descriptive report with quartiles and an ASCII histogram. The coupon collector problem asks how many random draws are needed to collect all n coupons; the expected count is n times the nth harmonic number, about n log n.

Coupon Collector Simulator in two sentences: The coupon collector problem asks how many random draws are needed to collect all n coupons; the expected count is n times the nth harmonic number, about n log n. Simulation shows the long tail as the last few coupons take forever. The tool reports the distribution of completion times.

## Architecture Talking Points

- Components: a single module plus the CLI entrypoint — each maps to a real module in `src/`, and the data-flow diagram shows how they connect.
- Algorithm: Descriptive statistics with linear-interpolation percentiles; runs in O(n log n) for the sort; O(n) for the histogram pass.
- Honest scaling limit: The sample is sorted in memory, so multi-million-point samples would need a streaming quantile sketch instead.

Use these when someone asks "how does it work?" — start with the problem, then walk the data flow, then name one trade-off. Trade-offs are what interviewers remember.

## Resume Bullet

Copy-paste ready (adapt the verbs to your own voice):

```
Built a Coupon Collector Simulator statistical analyzer in pure Python computing mean, median, stdev, quartiles, and histograms from seeded synthetic data; prints a formatted report with an ASCII distribution plot.
```

**Placement tips:**

1. Put this under a "Projects" section near the top of your resume if the project is the strongest evidence of the skill the job asks for; otherwise place it in an appendix or portfolio link and keep the bullet lean.
2. Never put two bullets from the same project on a resume — pick the single bullet that best matches the job description and cut the rest.

## Interview Q&A

**Q:** What distribution does the sample follow?

**A:** A two-component Gaussian mixture, which gives the histogram a visible bimodal shape instead of a flat bell curve.

**Q:** Are the sample size and bins configurable?

**A:** Yes; pass --samples and --bins to control the draw size and histogram resolution.

**Q:** Does it save the report anywhere?

**A:** No; it prints to stdout only, so results can be redirected or piped freely.
