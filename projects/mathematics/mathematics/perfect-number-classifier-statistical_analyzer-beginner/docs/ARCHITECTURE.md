# Architecture (HLD) — Abundant, Deficient, and Perfect Number Classifier: Statistical Analyzer

## Problem & Users

Abundant, Deficient, and Perfect Number Classifier built as a Statistical analyzer. A number is perfect when its proper divisors sum to itself (like 6 and 28), abundant when the sum exceeds it, and deficient otherwise. The divisor sum comes from the prime factorization via the multiplicative sigma function. The classifier scans ranges and reports the rare perfect numbers it finds. Draws a seeded synthetic sample and reports count, mean, median, stdev, quartiles, and an ASCII histogram.

The intended user is a student or engineer working in mathematics (mathematics) who needs a working, runnable reference for Abundant, Deficient, and Perfect Number Classifier — something they can read end to end, run in seconds, and adapt to their own data or experiments.

## System Components

| Component | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entrypoint | main | Argument parsing and demo orchestration via main() |

Each component maps to a real module in the project; no box in this design is aspirational — everything named here exists in the source tree.

## Data Flow

```
--seed -> generate_sample (mixture model)
sample -> summarize (sort, moments, percentiles, histogram)
summary -> print_report (table + ASCII histogram)
```

## Storage

In-memory only: the sample and summary exist for the duration of the run and nothing is persisted.

## Scaling & Limits

The sample is sorted in memory, so multi-million-point samples would need a streaming quantile sketch instead.

## Trade-offs

Hand-rolled statistics avoid dependencies but only cover univariate descriptives, not hypothesis tests or modeling.

## Failure Handling

An empty sample cannot occur (n comes from --samples), and a constant sample degrades gracefully to a single non-empty histogram bin.

*Design intent:* this document deliberately favors honesty over hype. Every claim above corresponds to something the code actually does; where the implementation is a teaching simplification, that is stated rather than hidden.
